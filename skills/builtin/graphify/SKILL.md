# Graphify Codebase Visualization

Use Graphify to turn a workspace folder into an interactive knowledge graph and report. Prefer this skill for requests like "graph this repo", "visualize this codebase", "map the workspace", or "show me the project structure as a graph".

## Prerequisites

Graphify is exposed as a curated Pibo CLI tool:

```bash
pibo tools show graphify
pibo tools install graphify
eval "$(pibo tools env graphify)"
```

Inside the Pibo source repo while testing local changes, use:

```bash
npm run --silent dev -- tools show graphify
npm run --silent dev -- tools install graphify
eval "$(npm run --silent dev -- tools env graphify)"
```

The Pibo installer uses the PyPI package `graphifyy` and runs `graphify install --platform pi` after installing the CLI.

## Workflow

1. Identify the workspace path from the active Pibo Room/session context or from the user's request.
2. Confirm the path is inside the intended workspace boundary before graphing.
3. Prefer an ignored artifact directory for generated files when possible. If you generate in the repo root, check `git status --short` before and after.
4. Run Graphify on the selected folder.
5. Read `GRAPH_REPORT.md` first for the summary, then open `graph.html` when the user wants an interactive view.

```bash
cd /path/to/workspace
graphify .
ls graph.html graph.json GRAPH_REPORT.md
```

## Operating rules

- Treat `graph.html`, `graph.json`, and `GRAPH_REPORT.md` as derived artifacts unless the user explicitly wants them committed.
- For large monorepos, start with a focused subdirectory such as `src/`, `docs/`, or one package.
- Re-run Graphify on demand after branch or workspace changes; do not assume an old graph is current.
- If Graphify is unavailable, report the missing install and suggest `pibo tools install graphify` rather than hand-writing a replacement graph.
