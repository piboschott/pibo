## Scope

Implement:

- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/proposal.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/spec.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/design.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/tasks.md`

- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prds/*.md`
- `TERMINAL_DESIGN.md`

## Operating notes

- Work in the dedicated host worktree above.
- Reuse the existing Docker dev worker for runtime, tests, builds, dev gateway/browser checks, and PTY validation.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless explicitly asked.
- Do not restart or modify host services.
- Run container commands as `docker exec pibo-dev-ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git metadata is not available inside the container. Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path.
- Clean stale Chrome/Chromium/Playwright/Puppeteer processes inside the Docker worker at the start and end of every Ralph session, and after any browser/CDP validation.
- Batch stories fluidly: choose as many related failing stories as can be implemented, fully verified, and committed safely. There is no fixed cap of three stories.
- If a story is large or risky, do only that story or a smaller coherent slice.
- Commit after each completed story or coherent story group.
- Before starting new work, review recent commits in this worktree/branch.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-17: Created worktree, committed PRD Markdown/JSON batch, started Docker dev worker, prepared Ralph job prompt, and created stopped Ralph job `ralph_2573cc4a-d1d4-4a0e-88e9-c6224222c2d4`.
- 2026-05-17: Validated Docker worker access and replaced the Ralph prompt Chrome cleanup command with exact-name `pkill -x` cleanup so the cleanup command does not match and terminate its own shell.
- 2026-05-17: Confirmed target room `room_d45b1be3-7317-4c35-86b3-5e4550336cdc`, set Ralph max iterations to 105, and tightened the job prompt using outcome-first prompting guidance.

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 01 design contract and guardrails

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 01 `US-002` Codify non-negotiable terminal design rules.
- PRD 01 `US-003` Add static renderer-boundary guardrails.
- PRD 01 `US-004` Create audit-backed implementation gate for future stories.
- Opportunistic support for PRD 01 `US-001` only if PTY artifacts can be captured after the worker build is restored; otherwise leave it false.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Add a concrete design-contract/checklist document under `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/` and point the PRD catalog at it.
2. Strengthen static source tests so shared `src/session-ui` stays renderer-neutral, `src/apps/cli-ui` stays Web-free, and supported rich cards are proven to route through shared descriptors with redaction before rendering.
3. Run focused tests in the Docker worker after building dist: `node --test test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs` and `npm run typecheck`.
4. If feasible, run PTY smoke/audit flows with `pibo debug pty` and save artifacts under `.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/`, then create an audit report under `docs/reports/`; otherwise document the blocker and keep `US-001` false.
5. Mark only fully verified stories `passes: true`, update notes with commands/evidence/artifacts, run final browser cleanup, and commit the coherent group from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 01 `US-001` through `US-004`.

Changes:

- Added `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/terminal-design-contract.md` with mandatory pass/fail rendering rules, `state.message` policy, allowed renderer differences, forbidden parity claims, visual evidence checklist, and traceability.
- Added `docs/reports/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity-audit-2026-05-17.md` with PTY artifact paths, exact commands, element classification, design comparison, limitations, and visual conversion fallback.
- Linked the PRD catalog to the visual evidence gate.
- Strengthened static/shared descriptor tests in `test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs` and added `test/ink-cli-terminal-design-contract.test.mjs`.
- Fixed reusable PTY smoke scenario assertions in `scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs` and `test/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.test.mjs` so they match current compact terminal output and room selection.
- Marked PRD 01 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed.
- `node --test test/ink-cli-terminal-design-contract.test.mjs test/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.test.mjs test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs` — passed, 26 tests.
- `node scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs --artifact-root .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17` — owner/session and slash/status/thinking scenarios passed after smoke assertion updates; existing-session truncation assertion was corrected and rerun separately.
- `node scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs --scenario existing-session-hydration --artifact-root .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17` — passed.
- `node dist/bin/pibo.js debug pty run --artifact --artifact-dir .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/running-row-demo ...` — passed.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm test` — passed, 661 tests.

Evidence/artifacts:

- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/owner-room-session-message`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/slash-suggestions-status-thinking`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/existing-session-hydration`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/running-row-demo`

Each artifact directory contains `raw.ansi.log`, `clean.txt`, `screen.txt`, `metadata.json`, `input.json`, `assertions.json`, and `events.jsonl`. Evidence tiers are mocked default TUI path for the first three scenarios and demo renderer PTY for running rows. Visual HTML/SVG/PNG conversion is documented as a fallback in the audit report.

Remaining limitations:

- Running/streaming row evidence is demo-only, not real provider streaming.
- Final installed/global `pibo tui:sessions` smoke remains for PRD 07/final completion.
- PRDs 02-07 remain incomplete.

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 02 shared render flow fixtures

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 02 `US-001` Build canonical compact-terminal fixture helpers.
- PRD 02 `US-002` Assert shared row order, descriptors, tones, and redaction.
- PRD 02 `US-003` Preserve streaming and chronological ordering semantics.
- PRD 02 `US-004` Share details and bounded previews across Web and Ink.
- PRD 02 `US-005` Prove Web and Ink consume the same fixture source.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Add renderer-neutral test fixtures under `test/fixtures/` that generate canonical trace rows, streaming rows, local command/result rows, status usage variants, details, long payloads, and secret-bearing values from shared `dist/session-ui` contracts.
2. Add focused shared-model parity tests for exact row/card order, order metadata, token tones, progress states, redaction, stable local command ids, detail labels, and bounded previews.
3. Update Web/source and Ink renderer tests to import the same fixture source and assert equivalent semantic hooks/output without crossing renderer boundaries.
4. Run focused tests in the Docker worker after build, then run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`. No PTY run is planned for this fixture-only batch because no user-visible TUI behavior changes are expected; evidence tier is fixture/source/unit.
5. Mark PRD 02 stories true only if criteria are satisfied, update notes/progress with commands and evidence, run browser cleanup, and commit from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 02 `US-001` through `US-005`.

Changes:

- Added `test/fixtures/terminal-parity-fixtures.mjs` as the canonical renderer-neutral fixture source for shared Web/Ink parity tests.
- Added `test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs` covering row/card order, streaming order metadata, stable local command ids, status progress variants, redaction, bounded detail previews, Web semantic hooks, and Ink output from the same fixture.
- Updated `test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs` and `test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs` to import the canonical fixture source directly.
- Preserved order/event/run metadata on grouped exploring rows in `src/session-ui/terminalRows.ts` so grouped rows keep renderer-visible ordering hooks.
- Marked PRD 02 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes and updated completed task checkboxes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed; includes `chat-ui:build` and `context-files-ui:build`.
- `node --test test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/ink-cli-terminal-design-contract.test.mjs` — passed, 30 tests.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed; includes `chat-ui:typecheck` and `context-files-ui:typecheck`.
- `npm test` — passed, 668 tests.

Evidence/artifacts:

- Evidence tier: fixture/source/unit.
- PTY artifacts: not applicable for this fixture-only batch; no user-visible TUI behavior was changed.
- Web checks: source-level semantic hook checks plus `chat-ui:typecheck`/`chat-ui:build` through the commands above.

Remaining limitations / next stories:

- PRD 03 remains incomplete for command-result row conversion in the live controller path and slash palette placement.
- PRDs 04-07 remain incomplete for renderer refinements, picker overlays, PTY visual parity artifacts, installed CLI smoke, and final evidence.

Commit:

- `e38d4cb` test: add terminal parity shared fixtures

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 03 command-result transcript flow and slash anchoring

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 03 `US-001` Render compact slash palette anchored to input.
- PRD 03 `US-002` Normalize command results into transcript rows.
- PRD 03 `US-003` Apply transcript flow to all command result families.
- PRD 03 `US-004` Preserve ordering across pickers and streaming state.
- PRD 03 `US-005` only if focused tests plus PTY slash/status artifacts can be captured in this run; otherwise leave false and record remaining evidence.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Move slash suggestions in `InkSessionAppView` to render next to the prompt after the transcript, keeping shared catalog/filtering and keyboard behavior intact.
2. Add a small CLI-local command-result application helper so `/status`, direct `/thinking`, `/model`, `/login`, shared Web actions, unsupported commands, command errors, and menu selections append stable `execution.command` plus result rows instead of status payloads in `state.message`; keep `state.message` only for guidance/picker/cancellation cases.
3. Preserve command-result rows during session-opening results by letting the open-session path carry local command rows into the newly opened transcript.
4. Extend focused controller/render tests for command families, unsupported/error redaction, picker-open and streaming ordering, and slash palette order near the input.
5. Run focused tests in the Docker worker after build, then `npm run typecheck`; run PTY slash/status scenario if feasible and save artifacts under `.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17`.
6. Mark only fully verified PRD stories true, update notes/progress with commands, evidence tier, artifacts, limitations, run browser cleanup, and commit from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 03 `US-001` through `US-005`.

Changes:

- Moved slash suggestions in `InkSessionAppView` below the transcript and immediately above the prompt so the palette is visually anchored to typed input instead of floating above the transcript.
- Centralized CLI-local command result application through `CommandResultDescriptor` to `CompactTerminalRow[]` conversion and `applyCommandResultToState`.
- Changed `/status`, direct `/thinking`, `/model`, `/login`, shared Web action commands, unsupported commands, and command errors to append transcript rows and clear picker/suggestion state instead of rendering command payloads only in `state.message`.
- Preserved clone/fork/session-opening command result rows by carrying local command rows into the newly opened session transcript.
- Extended PTY slash smoke coverage for `/`, `/st`, `/status`, unsupported `/download`, and `/thinking`; captured an additional `/status`-while-room-picker PTY artifact.
- Marked PRD 03 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes and updated completed task checkboxes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed; includes `chat-ui:build` and `context-files-ui:build`.
- `node --test test/cli-ui-session-app.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs` — passed, 52 tests.
- `node --test test/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.test.mjs test/cli-ui-session-app.test.mjs` — passed, 31 tests.
- `node scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs --scenario slash-suggestions-status-thinking --artifact-root .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17` — passed.
- `node dist/bin/pibo.js debug pty run --artifact --artifact-dir .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17/status-while-picker ... -- node dist/bin/pibo.js tui:sessions --owner-scope user:picker` — passed.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm test` — passed, 669 tests.

Evidence/artifacts:

- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17/slash-suggestions-status-thinking`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17/status-while-picker`

Each artifact directory contains `raw.ansi.log`, `clean.txt`, `screen.txt`, `metadata.json`, `input.json`, `assertions.json`, and `events.jsonl`. Evidence classification is mocked default TUI path; no live-provider behavior was required for this PRD. Visual HTML/SVG/PNG conversion fallback remains documented in the existing audit report.

Remaining limitations / next stories:

- PRD 04 remains incomplete for higher-quality Ink row/card primitives, all row kind semantic coverage, details/long-output safety, narrow/no-color coverage, and mixed-transcript PTY evidence.
- PRDs 05-07 remain incomplete for status card parity, picker overlay polish, visual artifact standardization, installed CLI smoke, and final evidence.

Commit:

- `78db622` feat: route CLI command results into transcript

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 04 Ink compact terminal renderer

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 04 `US-001` Build compact Ink terminal row primitives.
- PRD 04 `US-002` Render every required row kind with distinct semantics.
- PRD 04 `US-003` Render inline details, JSON, markdown, and long output safely.
- PRD 04 `US-004` Support narrow terminals and NO_COLOR readability.
- PRD 04 `US-005` only if mixed-transcript PTY artifacts and full `npm test` complete in this run; otherwise leave false with remaining evidence recorded.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Refine CLI-only Ink row/card primitives so shared rows render through a stable prefix/content layout, dense semantic markers, bounded card/detail lines, and no Web renderer imports.
2. Add inline detail rendering for `detailItems`, linked sessions, input/output/error sections, redaction, long JSON/markdown bounds, and long unbroken token handling without unbounded dumps.
3. Add no-color/limited-glyph progress-bar fallback and semantic renderer tests covering all PRD 04 row kinds, user/assistant marker distinction, details, narrow output, and bounded large transcripts.
4. Run focused Docker checks after build: `npm run build`, `node --test test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs test/ink-cli-terminal-design-contract.test.mjs`, then `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`.
5. If feasible, run a mixed-transcript `pibo debug pty` scenario with artifacts under `.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd04-2026-05-17`, record artifact paths/evidence tier, then mark fully verified PRD 04 stories and commit from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 04 `US-001` through `US-005`.

Changes:

- Refined `InkTerminalRow`/`InkTerminalCard` rendering with compact descriptor-driven row/card output, stable prefix/content semantics, and no Web renderer dependencies.
- Added inline detail rendering for shared `detailItems`, linked session rows, Input/Output/Error/command/tool labels, bounded JSON/markdown/string previews, and redacted detail text.
- Added ASCII progress fallback for `NO_COLOR=1`, `TERM=dumb`, or `PIBO_ASCII_PROGRESS=1` while preserving Unicode bars in normal output.
- Extended `test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs` for every required row kind, user/assistant marker distinction, inline detail bounds/redaction, narrow readability, no-color readability, ASCII progress fallback, and large transcript tail windows.
- Marked PRD 04 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes and updated renderer task checkboxes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed; includes `chat-ui:build` and `context-files-ui:build`.
- `node --test test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs test/ink-cli-terminal-design-contract.test.mjs` — passed, 20 tests.
- `node dist/bin/pibo.js debug pty run --artifact ... mixed-transcript ...` — passed.
- `node dist/bin/pibo.js debug pty run --artifact ... narrow-no-color ...` — passed.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed; includes `chat-ui:typecheck` and `context-files-ui:typecheck`.
- `npm test` — passed, 672 tests.

Evidence/artifacts:

- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd04-2026-05-17/mixed-transcript`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd04-2026-05-17/narrow-no-color`

Each artifact directory contains `raw.ansi.log`, `clean.txt`, `screen.txt`, `metadata.json`, `input.json`, `assertions.json`, and `events.jsonl`. Evidence classification is deterministic fixture/demo renderer PTY, not live provider/default installed `pibo tui:sessions`. The final real/default installed CLI smoke remains for PRD 07.

Remaining limitations / next stories:

- PRD 05 remains incomplete for richer shared status fixture coverage, compact status-card parity details, Web status hooks, and live/default `/status` PTY evidence.
- PRDs 06-07 remain incomplete for polished overlays, standardized visual artifact generation, installed CLI smoke, and final evidence report.

Commit:

- `ecbdafd` feat: refine Ink compact terminal renderer

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 05 status and runtime cards

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 05 `US-001` Create shared status fixtures and view-model assertions.
- PRD 05 `US-002` Render compact Ink status card with bars and unavailable states.
- PRD 05 `US-003` Place `/status` in transcript flow for live controller path.
- PRD 05 `US-004` Keep Web TerminalStatusCard parity hooks and shared descriptor use.
- PRD 05 `US-005` Validate status cards through PTY artifacts, if focused tests and PTY status artifacts complete in this run.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Extend the renderer-neutral status view model and fixture helpers to cover full/partial/unavailable/zero/high/error/disposed/non-OpenAI/queued/streaming/tool/credit states with provider labels, reset/remaining/plan/credit details, tool counts, and redaction.
2. Refine Ink status-card rendering only in `src/apps/cli-ui` to keep owner/session compact, render unavailable usage concisely, preserve context/provider bars including NO_COLOR ASCII fallback, and keep warnings/errors high signal.
3. Add Web status semantic hooks without redesigning the Web card and remove any provider hardcoding that conflicts with descriptor data.
4. Extend focused shared-model, Ink renderer, Web source, and CLI controller tests for `/status` transcript flow, partial/no-session/source-error handling, streaming-tail order, non-OpenAI provider labels, credits/tools, unavailable vs zero, and redaction.
5. Run Docker validation: `npm run build`, focused `node --test ...`, status PTY scenarios under `.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd05-2026-05-17`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm test`; then mark PRD 05 stories true only with evidence notes and commit from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 05 `US-001` through `US-005`.

Changes:

- Extended the shared status view model with session status, disposed state, active/enabled tools, provider plan, provider credits, provider remaining/reset details, and redaction-preserving status fields.
- Added deterministic status fixtures for full, partial, unavailable, zero, high-usage, non-OpenAI provider, queued/processing/streaming, warning/error, secret-bearing, and disposed states.
- Refined Ink status cards with a compact primary summary, status bars, concise unavailable rows, NO_COLOR ASCII fallback, tool/credit fields, and warning/error lines.
- Kept `/status` in transcript flow and preserved live/streaming row ordering with controller tests.
- Added Web Compact Terminal semantic hooks for shared status fields, progress availability, provider progress, warnings, and errors while keeping Web status rendering descriptor-driven.
- Marked PRD 05 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes and checked off task 4.2.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed; includes `chat-ui:build` and `context-files-ui:build`.
- `node --test test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/cli-ui-session-app.test.mjs test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs` — passed, 57 tests.
- `node scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs --scenario slash-suggestions-status-thinking --artifact-root .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd05-2026-05-17` — passed.
- `node dist/bin/pibo.js debug pty run --artifact ... status-fixture-bars ...` — passed.
- `node dist/bin/pibo.js debug pty run --artifact ... status-fixture-narrow-no-color ... --env NO_COLOR=1` — passed.
- Secret/NO_COLOR artifact grep over status PTY `clean.txt`/`screen.txt` — passed.
- `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run chat-ui:typecheck && npm run chat-ui:build` — passed; `npm test` reported 674 tests.

Evidence/artifacts:

- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd05-2026-05-17/slash-suggestions-status-thinking`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd05-2026-05-17/status-fixture-bars`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd05-2026-05-17/status-fixture-narrow-no-color`

Each artifact directory contains `raw.ansi.log`, `clean.txt`, `screen.txt`, `metadata.json`, `input.json`, `assertions.json`, and `events.jsonl`. Evidence classification is mocked default TUI path for `/status` flow plus deterministic fixture/demo renderer PTY for rich quota/context bars, unavailable state, narrow width, and NO_COLOR fallback. Visual HTML/SVG/PNG conversion remains the existing documented fallback; PRD 07 still owns standardizing visual conversion.

Remaining limitations / next stories:

- PRD 06 remains incomplete for polished picker/overlay semantics and PTY keyboard-flow evidence.
- PRD 07 remains incomplete for standardized visual artifacts, installed/global CLI smoke, final Web checks, and final evidence report.

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 06 picker overlays and keyboard flows

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 06 `US-001` Implement shared compact overlay style.
- PRD 06 `US-002` Redesign owner, room, and session navigation pickers.
- PRD 06 `US-003` Implement thinking, model, and login keyboard overlays.
- PRD 06 `US-004` Handle fork, clone, browser-only, and unsupported actions compactly.
- PRD 06 `US-005` Validate overlay keyboard flows through PTY, if focused tests and full `npm test` complete in this run.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Refine CLI-only picker/suggestion rendering into one compact terminal overlay grammar: terse lower-case title, `❯` selected marker, primary label first, dim secondary metadata, disabled markers/reasons, and compact `↑↓ enter esc ctrl-c` hint.
2. Improve picker item shaping for owners, rooms, sessions, agents, thinking/model/login/fork command menus so human-readable labels dominate and long ids move to abbreviated secondary metadata/details.
3. Keep picker UI ephemeral by not appending overlays to transcript rows; keep command-producing outcomes in existing command-result rows, including disabled/unavailable feedback and clone/fork/session-link flow.
4. Extend focused Ink render/controller tests for owner/room/session overlays, nested model/login/thinking menus, disabled/unavailable rows, Escape back, direct command semantics, and redaction/no secret echo.
5. Add or reuse PTY scenarios under `.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd06-2026-05-17` for startup owner/room/session flow, slash/status while picker open, thinking, nested model/login deterministic flows, disabled/unavailable rows, Escape/back, Enter, and Ctrl+C; then run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`.
6. Mark PRD 06 stories true only with evidence notes, update tasks/progress, run browser cleanup, and commit from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 06 `US-001` through `US-005`.

Changes:

- Reworked `InkSessionPickerView` and `InkSlashSuggestionsView` into a shared compact overlay grammar: terse lowercase titles, `❯` selected marker, `×` disabled marker, primary label first, dim/secondary metadata after `·`, and a consistent `↑↓ select · enter ... · esc ... · ctrl-c exit` hint.
- Updated owner, room, session, create-session, agent, thinking, model, login, and fork picker item shaping so long owner scopes/session ids/room ids are abbreviated secondary metadata instead of dominant primary text.
- Added room selection semantics for `/room` and parent room-picker state for room→session flows so Escape can back out of the session picker without corrupting selection/input.
- Extended reusable PTY smoke coverage with `overlay-keyboard-model-login` for nested model/login overlays, Escape/back behavior, disabled provider feedback, API-key safe instructions, and `/status` while a picker is open.
- Updated PTY smoke docs/tests for the compact overlay copy and marked PRD 06 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed; includes `chat-ui:build` and `context-files-ui:build`.
- `node --test test/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.test.mjs test/cli-ui-session-app.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs` — passed, 52 tests.
- `node scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs --scenario owner-room-session-message --artifact-root .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd06-2026-05-17` — passed.

- Redaction grep over PRD06 PTY `clean.txt`/`screen.txt` for unredacted secret-shaped values — passed.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm test` — passed, 675 tests.

- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd06-2026-05-17/owner-room-session-message`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd06-2026-05-17/slash-suggestions-status-thinking`

Each artifact directory contains `raw.ansi.log`, `clean.txt`, `screen.txt`, `metadata.json`, `input.json`, `assertions.json`, and `events.jsonl`. Evidence classification is deterministic debug/local PTY with mocked/debug provider data where needed, plus focused unit/controller/source tests. Visual HTML/SVG/PNG conversion remains the documented fallback and PRD 07 owns final standardization.

Remaining limitations / next stories:

- PRD 07 remains incomplete for standardized visual artifacts/goldens, installed/global `pibo tui:sessions` PTY smoke, final Web checks, and the final parity evidence report.

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 07 visual debugging and final validation

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 07 `US-001` Standardize PTY rendering-parity artifact capture.
- PRD 07 `US-002` Generate reviewable ANSI visual artifacts or documented fallback.
- PRD 07 `US-003` Add golden and semantic screen regression checks.
- PRD 07 `US-004` Complete Web regression and shared-fixture validation.
- PRD 07 `US-005` Run final installed CLI and full validation gates.
- PRD 07 `US-006` Publish final parity evidence report.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Extend the reusable PTY smoke runner and docs for final rendering-parity scenarios: startup owner/room/session, slash/status, status while picker open, deterministic model/login overlay, existing transcript, mixed transcript fixture, narrow width, and `NO_COLOR=1`, with bounded timeouts, deterministic env, expect/reject assertions, exact command output, and artifact paths.
2. Add a lightweight review artifact generator for captured PTY directories that emits terminal-styled HTML from `screen.txt`/`clean.txt` as the documented fallback when full ANSI-to-image tooling is unavailable.
3. Add focused golden/semantic regression tests for normalized Ink screens and Web shared-descriptor hooks so dashboard-style dumps, detached `state.message` status payloads, dominant UUID labels, ordering drift, missing hooks, and secret leaks fail early.
4. Run focused Docker validation first (`npm run build`, focused node tests, PTY final scenarios, visual artifact generation), then final gates: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run chat-ui:typecheck`, `npm run chat-ui:build`, plus a globally installed `pibo tui:sessions` PTY smoke in the dedicated worker.
5. Update PRD 07 JSON notes, tasks, PRD catalog, and final report with commands, evidence tiers, artifact directories, visual artifact/fallback paths, Web checks, limitations, and commit hash; run container browser cleanup before ending and commit from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 07 `US-001` through `US-006`; all 35 PRD JSON stories now have `passes: true`.

Changes:

- Extended `scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs` with final rendering-parity scenarios for mixed transcript/rich cards and narrow `NO_COLOR=1` status output, including reject assertions for secrets and Unicode bars where appropriate.
- Added `scripts/render-pty-artifact-html.mjs`, a terminal-styled HTML fallback generator for captured PTY artifact directories.
- Added `test/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity-final.test.mjs` for golden/semantic screen checks, visual artifact script checks, final PTY runner coverage, and Web shared-hook/source regression checks.
- Added Web shared terminal card hooks for thinking, model, and login cards while preserving renderer separation.
- Added `docs/reports/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity-final-2026-05-17.md` and updated PTY scenario docs, PRD catalog, tasks, and PRD 07 JSON notes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed.
- Focused: `node --test test/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity-final.test.mjs test/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.test.mjs test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/cli-ui-session-app.test.mjs` — passed, 57 tests.
- PTY final scenarios — passed: `mixed-transcript-fixture`, `narrow-no-color-status`, `slash-suggestions-status-thinking`, `overlay-keyboard-model-login`, `owner-room-session-message`, `existing-session-hydration` under `.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd07-2026-05-17`.
- Visual fallback generation — passed for mixed transcript, slash/status, overlay/model/login, and installed slash/status artifact dirs.
- Installed/global smoke — passed after `npm install -g .`: `installed-owner-room-session-message`, `installed-slash-status-thinking`, `installed-picker-open-status`, `installed-narrow-no-color-status` using installed `pibo debug pty run -- ... pibo tui:sessions`.
- Final gates — passed: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (680 tests), `npm run chat-ui:typecheck`, `npm run chat-ui:build`.
- Final browser cleanup in the Docker worker — completed.

Each PTY directory contains raw ANSI, clean text, final screen, metadata, input, assertions, and events where available. Reviewable fallback HTML was generated as `visual.html` for representative deterministic and installed artifact directories.

Remaining limitations:

- `visual.html` is a documented review fallback from `screen.txt`/`clean.txt`, not a color-accurate ANSI-to-PNG/SVG terminal emulator screenshot.
- Live-provider streaming was not exercised; deterministic fixtures and mocked default TUI paths cover streaming/running row order without credentials.
- Web browser screenshot capture was not run; shared descriptors, source hooks, typecheck, and build are the Web reference evidence.
