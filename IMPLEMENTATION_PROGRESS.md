## Scope

Implement:

- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/proposal.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/spec.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/design.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/tasks.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prds/prd_*.json`
- `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prds/*.md`
- `TERMINAL_DESIGN.md`

## Operating notes

- Work in the dedicated host worktree above.
- Reuse the existing Docker dev worker for runtime, tests, builds, dev gateway/browser checks, and PTY validation.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless explicitly asked.
- Do not restart or modify host services.
- Run container commands as `docker exec pibo-dev-ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git metadata is not available inside the container. Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path.
- Clean stale Chrome/Chromium/Playwright/Puppeteer processes inside the Docker worker at the start and end of every Ralph session, and after any browser/CDP validation.
- Batch stories fluidly: choose as many related failing stories as can be implemented, fully verified, and committed safely. There is no fixed cap of three stories.
- If a story is large or risky, do only that story or a smaller coherent slice.
- Commit after each completed story or coherent story group.
- Before starting new work, review recent commits in this worktree/branch.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-17: Created worktree, committed PRD Markdown/JSON batch, started Docker dev worker, prepared Ralph job prompt, and created stopped Ralph job `ralph_2573cc4a-d1d4-4a0e-88e9-c6224222c2d4`.
- 2026-05-17: Validated Docker worker access and replaced the Ralph prompt Chrome cleanup command with exact-name `pkill -x` cleanup so the cleanup command does not match and terminate its own shell.
- 2026-05-17: Confirmed target room `room_d45b1be3-7317-4c35-86b3-5e4550336cdc`, set Ralph max iterations to 105, and tightened the job prompt using outcome-first prompting guidance.

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 01 design contract and guardrails

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 01 `US-002` Codify non-negotiable terminal design rules.
- PRD 01 `US-003` Add static renderer-boundary guardrails.
- PRD 01 `US-004` Create audit-backed implementation gate for future stories.
- Opportunistic support for PRD 01 `US-001` only if PTY artifacts can be captured after the worker build is restored; otherwise leave it false.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Add a concrete design-contract/checklist document under `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/` and point the PRD catalog at it.
2. Strengthen static source tests so shared `src/session-ui` stays renderer-neutral, `src/apps/cli-ui` stays Web-free, and supported rich cards are proven to route through shared descriptors with redaction before rendering.
3. Run focused tests in the Docker worker after building dist: `node --test test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs` and `npm run typecheck`.
4. If feasible, run PTY smoke/audit flows with `pibo debug pty` and save artifacts under `.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/`, then create an audit report under `docs/reports/`; otherwise document the blocker and keep `US-001` false.
5. Mark only fully verified stories `passes: true`, update notes with commands/evidence/artifacts, run final browser cleanup, and commit the coherent group from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 01 `US-001` through `US-004`.

Changes:

- Added `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/terminal-design-contract.md` with mandatory pass/fail rendering rules, `state.message` policy, allowed renderer differences, forbidden parity claims, visual evidence checklist, and traceability.
- Added `docs/reports/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity-audit-2026-05-17.md` with PTY artifact paths, exact commands, element classification, design comparison, limitations, and visual conversion fallback.
- Linked the PRD catalog to the visual evidence gate.
- Strengthened static/shared descriptor tests in `test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs` and added `test/ink-cli-terminal-design-contract.test.mjs`.
- Fixed reusable PTY smoke scenario assertions in `scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs` and `test/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.test.mjs` so they match current compact terminal output and room selection.
- Marked PRD 01 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed.
- `node --test test/ink-cli-terminal-design-contract.test.mjs test/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.test.mjs test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs` — passed, 26 tests.
- `node scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs --artifact-root .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17` — owner/session and slash/status/thinking scenarios passed after smoke assertion updates; existing-session truncation assertion was corrected and rerun separately.
- `node scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs --scenario existing-session-hydration --artifact-root .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17` — passed.
- `node dist/bin/pibo.js debug pty run --artifact --artifact-dir .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/running-row-demo ...` — passed.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm test` — passed, 661 tests.

Evidence/artifacts:

- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/owner-room-session-message`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/slash-suggestions-status-thinking`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/existing-session-hydration`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/audit-2026-05-17/running-row-demo`

Each artifact directory contains `raw.ansi.log`, `clean.txt`, `screen.txt`, `metadata.json`, `input.json`, `assertions.json`, and `events.jsonl`. Evidence tiers are mocked default TUI path for the first three scenarios and demo renderer PTY for running rows. Visual HTML/SVG/PNG conversion is documented as a fallback in the audit report.

Remaining limitations:

- Running/streaming row evidence is demo-only, not real provider streaming.
- Final installed/global `pibo tui:sessions` smoke remains for PRD 07/final completion.
- PRDs 02-07 remain incomplete.

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 02 shared render flow fixtures

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 02 `US-001` Build canonical compact-terminal fixture helpers.
- PRD 02 `US-002` Assert shared row order, descriptors, tones, and redaction.
- PRD 02 `US-003` Preserve streaming and chronological ordering semantics.
- PRD 02 `US-004` Share details and bounded previews across Web and Ink.
- PRD 02 `US-005` Prove Web and Ink consume the same fixture source.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Add renderer-neutral test fixtures under `test/fixtures/` that generate canonical trace rows, streaming rows, local command/result rows, status usage variants, details, long payloads, and secret-bearing values from shared `dist/session-ui` contracts.
2. Add focused shared-model parity tests for exact row/card order, order metadata, token tones, progress states, redaction, stable local command ids, detail labels, and bounded previews.
3. Update Web/source and Ink renderer tests to import the same fixture source and assert equivalent semantic hooks/output without crossing renderer boundaries.
4. Run focused tests in the Docker worker after build, then run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`. No PTY run is planned for this fixture-only batch because no user-visible TUI behavior changes are expected; evidence tier is fixture/source/unit.
5. Mark PRD 02 stories true only if criteria are satisfied, update notes/progress with commands and evidence, run browser cleanup, and commit from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 02 `US-001` through `US-005`.

Changes:

- Added `test/fixtures/terminal-parity-fixtures.mjs` as the canonical renderer-neutral fixture source for shared Web/Ink parity tests.
- Added `test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs` covering row/card order, streaming order metadata, stable local command ids, status progress variants, redaction, bounded detail previews, Web semantic hooks, and Ink output from the same fixture.
- Updated `test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs` and `test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs` to import the canonical fixture source directly.
- Preserved order/event/run metadata on grouped exploring rows in `src/session-ui/terminalRows.ts` so grouped rows keep renderer-visible ordering hooks.
- Marked PRD 02 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes and updated completed task checkboxes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed; includes `chat-ui:build` and `context-files-ui:build`.
- `node --test test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/ink-cli-terminal-design-contract.test.mjs` — passed, 30 tests.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed; includes `chat-ui:typecheck` and `context-files-ui:typecheck`.
- `npm test` — passed, 668 tests.

Evidence/artifacts:

- Evidence tier: fixture/source/unit.
- PTY artifacts: not applicable for this fixture-only batch; no user-visible TUI behavior was changed.
- Web checks: source-level semantic hook checks plus `chat-ui:typecheck`/`chat-ui:build` through the commands above.

Remaining limitations / next stories:

- PRD 03 remains incomplete for command-result row conversion in the live controller path and slash palette placement.
- PRDs 04-07 remain incomplete for renderer refinements, picker overlays, PTY visual parity artifacts, installed CLI smoke, and final evidence.

Commit:

- `e38d4cb` test: add terminal parity shared fixtures

## 2026-05-17 Ralph run: PRD 03 command-result transcript flow and slash anchoring

### Selected coherent story group

- PRD 03 `US-001` Render compact slash palette anchored to input.
- PRD 03 `US-002` Normalize command results into transcript rows.
- PRD 03 `US-003` Apply transcript flow to all command result families.
- PRD 03 `US-004` Preserve ordering across pickers and streaming state.
- PRD 03 `US-005` only if focused tests plus PTY slash/status artifacts can be captured in this run; otherwise leave false and record remaining evidence.

### Plan and validation approach

1. Move slash suggestions in `InkSessionAppView` to render next to the prompt after the transcript, keeping shared catalog/filtering and keyboard behavior intact.
2. Add a small CLI-local command-result application helper so `/status`, direct `/thinking`, `/model`, `/login`, shared Web actions, unsupported commands, command errors, and menu selections append stable `execution.command` plus result rows instead of status payloads in `state.message`; keep `state.message` only for guidance/picker/cancellation cases.
3. Preserve command-result rows during session-opening results by letting the open-session path carry local command rows into the newly opened transcript.
4. Extend focused controller/render tests for command families, unsupported/error redaction, picker-open and streaming ordering, and slash palette order near the input.
5. Run focused tests in the Docker worker after build, then `npm run typecheck`; run PTY slash/status scenario if feasible and save artifacts under `.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17`.
6. Mark only fully verified PRD stories true, update notes/progress with commands, evidence tier, artifacts, limitations, run browser cleanup, and commit from the host worktree.

### Result

Completed PRD 03 `US-001` through `US-005`.

Changes:

- Moved slash suggestions in `InkSessionAppView` below the transcript and immediately above the prompt so the palette is visually anchored to typed input instead of floating above the transcript.
- Centralized CLI-local command result application through `CommandResultDescriptor` to `CompactTerminalRow[]` conversion and `applyCommandResultToState`.
- Changed `/status`, direct `/thinking`, `/model`, `/login`, shared Web action commands, unsupported commands, and command errors to append transcript rows and clear picker/suggestion state instead of rendering command payloads only in `state.message`.
- Preserved clone/fork/session-opening command result rows by carrying local command rows into the newly opened session transcript.
- Extended PTY slash smoke coverage for `/`, `/st`, `/status`, unsupported `/download`, and `/thinking`; captured an additional `/status`-while-room-picker PTY artifact.
- Marked PRD 03 stories `passes: true` with evidence notes and updated completed task checkboxes.

Validation run in Docker worker:

- `npm run build` — passed; includes `chat-ui:build` and `context-files-ui:build`.
- `node --test test/cli-ui-session-app.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs test/session-ui-view-models.test.mjs` — passed, 52 tests.
- `node --test test/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.test.mjs test/cli-ui-session-app.test.mjs` — passed, 31 tests.
- `node scripts/ink-cli-v2-pty-smoke.mjs --scenario slash-suggestions-status-thinking --artifact-root .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17` — passed.
- `node dist/bin/pibo.js debug pty run --artifact --artifact-dir .tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17/status-while-picker ... -- node dist/bin/pibo.js tui:sessions --owner-scope user:picker` — passed.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm test` — passed, 669 tests.

Evidence/artifacts:

- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17/slash-suggestions-status-thinking`
- `/workspace/.tmp/ink-cli-terminal-rendering-parity/prd03-2026-05-17/status-while-picker`

Each artifact directory contains `raw.ansi.log`, `clean.txt`, `screen.txt`, `metadata.json`, `input.json`, `assertions.json`, and `events.jsonl`. Evidence classification is mocked default TUI path; no live-provider behavior was required for this PRD. Visual HTML/SVG/PNG conversion fallback remains documented in the existing audit report.

Remaining limitations / next stories:

- PRD 04 remains incomplete for higher-quality Ink row/card primitives, all row kind semantic coverage, details/long-output safety, narrow/no-color coverage, and mixed-transcript PTY evidence.
- PRDs 05-07 remain incomplete for status card parity, picker overlay polish, visual artifact standardization, installed CLI smoke, and final evidence.
