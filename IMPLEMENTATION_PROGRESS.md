## Operating notes

- Keep implementation work in the host worktree above.
- Use the Docker worker for runtime, builds, tests, PTY checks, dev gateway restarts, and browser/web verification.
- Run container commands as `docker exec pibo-dev-ink-cli-terminal-web-derived-parity bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless explicitly asked.
- Do not restart or modify host services such as `pibo-web.service`.
- Clean Chrome/Chromium/Playwright/Puppeteer processes inside the Docker worker at the start and end of each Ralph session and after browser checks. Avoid broad `pkill node` because it can kill worker services.
- Batch multiple user stories sensibly; there is no fixed 4/5 story cap. Stop a run when a coherent batch is complete, blocked, or validation fails.
- Commit after every completed story or coherent story group.
- Every user-facing TUI story must include the closest practical `pibo tui:sessions` / `pibo debug pty run` validation against the Terminal UI, not only render snapshots.
- Web-impacting stories require Web Compact Terminal regression checks.
- Fake/demo/mocked checks are supporting evidence; real/default-path checks are required when locally feasible.
- Web UI preservation gate is mandatory: Web Compact Terminal is the source of truth; Ink adapts to Web. Do not change Web Compact Terminal visual/behavioral render logic unless the user explicitly approves it. Any `src/session-ui/**` change is Web-impacting and requires Web regression evidence. Direct Web Compact Terminal edits are limited to tests/semantic hooks or restoring existing Web behavior.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-17: Created Phase 2 worktree and Docker worker. Prepared PRD batch for Ralph but did not start it yet.
- 2026-05-17: Created stopped Ralph job `ralph_fcef0e46-fe5e-45d3-95d4-7a0ef31db09d` with `maxIterations=90`, room `room_d1949701-2009-4b88-9a13-7eb4a3c8f466`, and prompt `/tmp/ralph-ink-cli-terminal-web-derived-parity-prompt.txt`.
- 2026-05-17: Cleaned browser processes in Docker worker with narrow process-name cleanup and verified container build command: `docker exec pibo-dev-ink-cli-terminal-web-derived-parity bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run build'` passed.
- 2026-05-17: Added and merged Web UI preservation gate from `dev`, updated Phase 2 PRD JSON acceptance criteria, and edited Ralph job prompt `ralph_fcef0e46-fe5e-45d3-95d4-7a0ef31db09d` so Web UI must remain unchanged and shared/Web-impacting changes require Web regression evidence.
- 2026-05-17: Selected PRD08 US-001 through US-005 as a coherent foundation batch: create the Web-vs-Ink difference matrix, add renderer-neutral long-output/JSON/markdown/room-session/slash fixtures, wire validation ownership, and mark only fixture/docs stories when focused tests and typecheck pass. No direct Web Compact Terminal behavior changes planned.
- 2026-05-17: Completed PRD08 US-001..US-005. Added `web-terminal-difference-matrix.md`, Web-derived fixture helpers for long output, JSON/markdown/syntax, room/session naming, slash-command coverage, and matrix coverage assertions. Evidence tier: docs/source/shared-fixture unit tests; fake deterministic fixtures, not live provider/default-path PTY. Web preservation: no Web Compact Terminal visual/behavioral code changed and no production `src/session-ui/**` change; Web-impacting regression handled by full test/build gates. Validation in Docker worker: `npm run build`; `node --test test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm test` all passed. No PTY artifacts required for PRD08 fixture/docs stories; PRD09+ own user-facing PTY evidence.
- 2026-05-17: Selected PRD09 US-001 and US-002 as the next coherent dependency batch: restore/verify Web collapsed preview bounds for output and exploration rows, add explicit omitted-preview metadata, preserve full detail payloads, and run shared/Web-impacting regression evidence because `src/session-ui/**` will change. Planned validation: Docker `npm run build`, focused shared fixture/terminal row tests, Web preservation source/fixture checks where available, `npm run typecheck`, and commit from host.
- 2026-05-17: Completed PRD09 US-001 and US-002. Added `CompactTerminalPreviewOmission` metadata and shared preview constants, kept five-line output previews, bounded collapsed exploration groups to six child summaries, preserved all detail payloads, and added focused tests for empty/fewer-than-limit, exactly-at-limit, over-limit, long-unbroken-token, long-output fixture rows, and grouped exploration metadata. Evidence tier: shared model/Web-impacting regression with deterministic fixtures; no live/default PTY in this batch because PRD09 US-005 owns long-output keyboard expansion PTY evidence. Web preservation: no direct Web Compact Terminal visual code changed; `src/session-ui/**` additive metadata/group bound changes were validated with Web source/fixture regression coverage. Docker validation passed: `npm run build`; `node --test test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm run chat-ui:typecheck`; `npm test` (744 tests). Next: PRD09 US-003/US-004 selected-row expansion and inline detail rendering, followed by PTY evidence in US-005.
- 2026-05-17: Selected PRD09 US-003 and US-004 as the next coherent batch: add Ink selected-row/expanded-row state and keyboard detail toggles, then render compact inline `Input`/`Output`/`Error`/linked-session details below the parent row. Planned validation: focused CLI app/controller and Ink renderer tests in Docker, `npm run typecheck`, and Web preservation source check because no Web Compact Terminal code changes are planned.
- 2026-05-17: Completed PRD09 US-003 and US-004. Added Ink row focus/expansion state, keyboard controls for Up/Down row focus and Enter/`d` detail toggles when the composer is empty, preserved slash/picker/message input behavior, and rendered expanded details inline below the parent row with `Details`, `Input`, `Output`, `Error`, linked session, and preview-omission disclosure. Evidence tier: focused unit/render tests plus deterministic fake/demo source through the real Ink TUI PTY path. Docker validation passed: `npm run build`; `node --test test/cli-ui-session-app.test.mjs test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs test/terminal-parity-fixtures.test.mjs`; `npm run typecheck`. PTY validation passed with artifacts at `/tmp/pibo-pty-detail-us003-pass2` using `npm run dev -- debug pty run --rows 36 --cols 120 --artifact --artifact-dir /tmp/pibo-pty-detail-us003-pass2 --wait-for "select room" --press Enter --wait-for "select session" --press Enter --wait-for "d/enter details" --type d --wait-for Details --press CtrlC --expect Details --expect "Opened row details" --reject detail-secret-value -- npm run dev -- tui:sessions --demo`. Web preservation: no Web Compact Terminal or shared `src/session-ui/**` production code changed; Web build/typecheck gates passed via `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck`. Next: PRD09 US-005 long-output preview/expansion PTY evidence, then PRD10 row-first normal event grammar.
- 2026-05-17: Full regression for PRD09 US-003/US-004 passed in Docker worker with `npm test` (745 tests).
