## Ralph job setup

- Created: 2026-05-17
- Owner scope: `user:ueR3mwuqBMPNTber3xuTwLmODbUlF4Sa`
- Target room: `room_378b95da-ae39-4154-bd2e-5177cd741780`
- Profile: `pibo-agent`
- Template: `prd-batch-stories`
- Worktree: `/root/code/pibo/.worktrees/compute-browser-resource-lifecycle`
- Branch: `compute-browser-resource-lifecycle`
- Docker dev worker: `pibo-dev-compute-browser-resource-lifecycle`
- Docker web port: `4832`
- Docker gateway port: `4830`
- Docker CDP port: `4831`

## Scope

Implement the PRD JSON stories under:

`docs/specs/changes/compute-browser-resource-lifecycle/prds/prd_*.json`

Related docs:

- `docs/specs/changes/compute-browser-resource-lifecycle/proposal.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/compute-browser-resource-lifecycle/spec.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/compute-browser-resource-lifecycle/design.md`
- `docs/specs/changes/compute-browser-resource-lifecycle/tasks.md`

## Operating notes

- Keep implementation work in this dedicated host worktree.
- Use the dedicated Docker dev worker for runtime, tests, builds, dev gateway restarts, and browser checks.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless explicitly asked.
- Do not restart or modify host `pibo-web.service`, `pibo-web-dev.service`, or production services.
- Run container commands as `docker exec <worker> bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path.
- Commit after each completed story or coherent story group.
- Before starting new work, review recent commits in this worktree/branch.
- For incomplete work, say `completion marker omitted` instead of writing the XML completion marker.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-17: Created worktree, copied specs/PRDs/JSON files, and prepared Ralph loop baseline.
- 2026-05-17: Rebuilt `pibo:latest` and started Docker dev worker `pibo-dev-compute-browser-resource-lifecycle` with manual safety limits (`2g` memory, `512` PIDs, `512m` shm).
