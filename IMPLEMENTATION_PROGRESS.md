## Mandatory startup checklist for every Ralph session

1. `cd /root/code/pibo/.worktrees/final-owner-scope-removal-ralph`.
2. Run `git status --short --branch` and inspect recent commits.
3. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` completely.
4. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_INSIGHTS.md` completely.
5. Read `docs/specs/changes/final-owner-scope-removal/prds/final-owner-scope-removal.prd.json`.
6. Read the related PRD, plan, inventory, and backup report before selecting work.
7. Pick the highest-priority `passes: false` story unless this file or insights document a safer dependency order.
8. Record the selected story group and plan in this file before editing.

## Operating rules

- Final target: no active Owner Scope model, no `shared:app` replacement owner, and no account-derived product Principal.
- Auth remains only an access gate; it must not control product visibility, workspace, route, jobs, profiles, read-state, or write location.
- Use the Docker worker for shell commands, builds, tests, gateway/browser checks, and runtime validation. Prefer: `.pibo/ralph-worker.sh '<command>'`.
- The helper runs commands in `/workspace` with `PIBO_HOME=/workspace/.pibo/ralph-sandbox`, a copy of the verified backup.
- Never run migration tests, dry-runs, exploratory data commands, or destructive CLI commands against `/root/.pibo`; use the sandbox copy.
- Keep source edits and git commits in the host worktree path above.
- Git commands must run on the host worktree; Docker may not resolve worktree Git metadata.
- Do not run builds/tests against the host checkout.
- Do not restart or modify host production/dev gateways or host services.
- Do not deploy, restart Production, force-restart Production, or mutate Production data.
- Production migration/apply remains separately approval-gated by the user.
- Do not create, release, or replace Docker workers unless the user explicitly approves.
- Commit after each completed story or coherent story group.
- Only set a PRD story's `passes` to `true` after implementation and evidence are complete.
- Keep `IMPLEMENTATION_INSIGHTS.md` updated with durable discoveries, gotchas, schema notes, and validation lessons.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-31T20:11Z: Setup started for final Owner Scope removal Ralph loop. Created/attached branch `final-owner-scope-removal-ralph` from `upstream/dev` at `f0c588e`, copied plan/PRD/inventory/backup docs, and committed setup docs as `ff4e454 docs: prepare final owner scope removal Ralph batch`.
- 2026-05-31T20:11Z: Docker dev worker created: `pibo-dev-final-owner-scope-removal-ralph` with ports gateway `4830`, CDP `4831`, web `4832`, Chat UI `4833`, Context UI `4834`; worktree `/root/code/pibo/.worktrees/final-owner-scope-removal-ralph`; container workspace `/workspace`.
- 2026-05-31T20:11Z: Created Chat room `room_130a1897-996d-47e2-b805-b8e93f10a53d` named `Ralph: Final Owner Scope Removal` with workspace metadata pointing to the worktree.
- 2026-05-31T20:15Z: Created sandbox Pibo home at `.pibo/ralph-sandbox` from verified backup `/root/.pibo/backups/final-owner-scope-removal-precutover-vacuum-20260531T194546Z` and added untracked helper `.pibo/ralph-worker.sh` for Docker commands.
- 2026-05-31T20:16Z: Created Ralph job `ralph_66995290-8189-43a3-a735-27d23e0230e4` stopped, target room `room_130a1897-996d-47e2-b805-b8e93f10a53d`, profile `pibo-agent`, template `prd-batch-stories`, max iterations `90`, prompt from `/tmp/final-owner-scope-ralph-prompt.txt`. Start command after review: `pibo ralph start ralph_66995290-8189-43a3-a735-27d23e0230e4`.
