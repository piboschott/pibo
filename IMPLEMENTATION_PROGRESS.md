## Mandatory startup checklist for every Ralph session

1. `cd /root/code/pibo/.worktrees/final-owner-scope-removal-ralph`.
2. Run `git status --short --branch` and inspect recent commits.
3. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` completely.
4. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_INSIGHTS.md` completely.
5. Read `docs/specs/changes/final-owner-scope-removal/prds/final-owner-scope-removal.prd.json`.
6. Read the related PRD, plan, inventory, and backup report before selecting work.
7. Pick the highest-priority `passes: false` story unless this file or insights document a safer dependency order.
8. Record the selected story group and plan in this file before editing.

## Operating rules

- Final target: no active Owner Scope model, no `shared:app` replacement owner, and no account-derived product Principal.
- Auth remains only an access gate; it must not control product visibility, workspace, route, jobs, profiles, read-state, or write location.
- Use the Docker worker for all shell commands, builds, tests, deploy/gateway checks, browser checks, PTY checks, runtime validation, and data/migration commands. Prefer: `.pibo/ralph-worker.sh '<command>'`.
- The helper runs commands in `/workspace` with a fresh test home at `PIBO_HOME=/workspace/.pibo/ralph-test-home`.
- Historical-data migration checks must use `PIBO_MIGRATION_SANDBOX_HOME=/workspace/.pibo/ralph-migration-sandbox`, not the fresh test home and never `/root/.pibo`.
- Never run migration tests, dry-runs, exploratory data commands, or destructive CLI commands against `/root/.pibo`; use Docker test homes only.
- Keep source edits and git commits in the host worktree path above.
- Git commands must run on the host worktree; Docker may not resolve worktree Git metadata.
- Do not run builds/tests against the host checkout.
- Deploy/restart/gateway validation is allowed only inside Docker or worker-local processes. Do not restart or modify host production/dev gateways or host services.
- Do not deploy, restart Production, force-restart Production, mutate Production data, or create an upstream PR.
- Before real database cutover or PR creation, stop and hand off for user review. Production migration/apply remains separately approval-gated by the user.
- Do not create, release, or replace Docker workers unless the user explicitly approves.
- Commit after each completed story or coherent story group.
- Only set a PRD story's `passes` to `true` after implementation and evidence are complete.
- Keep `IMPLEMENTATION_INSIGHTS.md` updated with durable discoveries, gotchas, schema notes, and validation lessons.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-31T20:11Z: Setup started for final Owner Scope removal Ralph loop. Created/attached branch `final-owner-scope-removal-ralph` from `upstream/dev` at `f0c588e`, copied plan/PRD/inventory/backup docs, and committed setup docs as `ff4e454 docs: prepare final owner scope removal Ralph batch`.
- 2026-05-31T20:11Z: Docker dev worker created: `pibo-dev-final-owner-scope-removal-ralph` with ports gateway `4830`, CDP `4831`, web `4832`, Chat UI `4833`, Context UI `4834`; worktree `/root/code/pibo/.worktrees/final-owner-scope-removal-ralph`; container workspace `/workspace`.
- 2026-05-31T20:11Z: Created Chat room `room_130a1897-996d-47e2-b805-b8e93f10a53d` named `Ralph: Final Owner Scope Removal` with workspace metadata pointing to the worktree.
- 2026-05-31T20:15Z: Created copied migration sandbox at `.pibo/ralph-sandbox` from verified backup `/root/.pibo/backups/final-owner-scope-removal-precutover-vacuum-20260531T194546Z`; exposed it as `.pibo/ralph-migration-sandbox`. Created separate fresh test home `.pibo/ralph-test-home`. Updated helper `.pibo/ralph-worker.sh` so normal commands use the fresh test home and migration validation can opt into `PIBO_MIGRATION_SANDBOX_HOME`.
- 2026-05-31T20:16Z: Created Ralph job `ralph_66995290-8189-43a3-a735-27d23e0230e4` stopped, target room `room_130a1897-996d-47e2-b805-b8e93f10a53d`, profile `pibo-agent`, template `prd-batch-stories`, max iterations `90`, prompt from `/tmp/final-owner-scope-ralph-prompt.txt`. Start command after review: `pibo ralph start ralph_66995290-8189-43a3-a735-27d23e0230e4`.
- 2026-05-31T20:31Z: User clarified loop safety boundaries. Updated PRD, PRD JSON, progress/insights, helper, and job prompt requirements: all runtime/deploy/gateway/data work must happen only in Docker; normal validation uses a fresh test database home; historical migration validation uses the copied migration sandbox; host/Production databases and host gateways remain untouched; Ralph must stop for user review before real database cutover and before PR creation.
- 2026-06-01T04:36Z: Selected story US-001 (`Establish final owner-scope removal baseline and progress tracking`) as the highest-priority `passes: false` story. Plan: (1) capture current owner/principal/search baseline counts inside the Docker worker using the fresh test home, (2) inspect reachable SQLite schemas read-only in the fresh Docker test home and copied migration sandbox without mutating data, (3) verify the fresh ownerless test home remains separate from the migration sandbox, (4) run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` inside Docker, (5) update US-001 notes/progress/insights and commit documentation-only baseline evidence. No runtime behavior changes planned.
- 2026-06-01T04:43Z: Completed US-001 baseline without runtime behavior changes.
  - Files changed: `docs/reports/final-owner-scope-removal-baseline-2026-06-01.md`, `docs/specs/changes/final-owner-scope-removal/prds/final-owner-scope-removal.prd.json`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_INSIGHTS.md`.
  - Baseline search evidence: inside Docker, `node_modules/@vscode/ripgrep-linux-x64/bin/rg -F` captured active source/docs counts for `ownerScope` 157 files / 1380 matches; `owner_scope` 59 / 350; `OwnerScope` 43 / 327; `owner-scope` 88 / 291; `shared:app` 23 / 140; `principalId` 44 / 216; `principal_id` 17 / 84; `room_members` 14 / 51; `listOwned` 7 / 18; `getOwned` 11 / 31; `requireOwned` 9 / 25; `personal target` 15 / 29; `active owner` 21 / 40; `--owner-scope` 36 / 102. Full worktree counts including current reports/raw inventory are recorded in the baseline report.
  - SQLite schema evidence: read-only Python `sqlite3` `mode=ro` inventory against `/workspace/.pibo/ralph-migration-sandbox` recorded owner/principal-like tables, columns, and indexes for affected copied sandbox DBs; `/workspace/.pibo/ralph-test-home` was verified as separate and currently contains no SQLite DBs.
  - Docker validation: `npm run typecheck` passed with `PIBO_HOME=/workspace/.pibo/ralph-test-home`; `npm run build` passed with the same fresh home. Build emitted only existing Vite chunk-size warnings.
  - Evidence tier: Docker build/typecheck plus read-only sandbox schema inspection and Docker search baseline.
  - Safety: no migration inspect/dry-run/apply commands were run; host `/root/.pibo`, host Dev/Production gateways, and Production data were not touched.
  - PRD update: US-001 set to `passes: true` with evidence notes.
  - Commit: `8ef39c9 docs: US-001 baseline owner scope removal`.
