# Observability Telemetry Implementation Progress

## Ralph job setup

- Created: 2026-05-16
- Owner scope: `user:ueR3mwuqBMPNTber3xuTwLmODbUlF4Sa`
- Target room: `room_d401420c-5553-4e68-a810-d1857510950d`
- Profile: `pibo-agent`
- Template: `prd-batch-stories`
- Worktree: `/root/code/pibo/.worktrees/ralph-observability-telemetry`
- Branch: `ralph-observability-telemetry`
- Docker dev worker: `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry`
- Docker web port: `4802`
- Docker gateway port: `4800`
- Docker CDP port: `4801`

## Scope

Implement all PRDs under:

`docs/specs/changes/pibo-observability-debug-telemetry/prds/prd_*.json`

## Operating notes

- Keep implementation work in the dedicated host worktree above.
- Reuse the existing Docker dev worker `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry` for runtime, tests, builds, and gateway restarts.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Do not restart or modify the host `pibo-web.service`.
- Run container commands as `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path. The container mounts the files at `/workspace`, but Git metadata may not resolve inside the container.
- Batch user stories sensibly. Stop the session when a coherent batch is complete.
- Commit after each completed story or coherent story group.
- Before starting new work, review recent commits in this worktree/branch.
- Keep this progress file updated with decisions, findings, completed stories, validation commands, commits, blockers, and next steps.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-16: Created dedicated worktree and Docker dev worker. Initial dev gateway validated on host port `4802`.
- 2026-05-16: Clarified Ralph operating contract: reuse the existing Docker dev worker for runtime/tests/gateway restarts, keep Git/commits in the host worktree, and never touch host `pibo-web.service`.
- 2026-05-16: Reviewed recent commits (`fa1f460`, `735f554`), clean branch status, glossary, source telemetry specs/design/tasks/decisions, all Markdown PRDs, and all Ralph PRD JSON files. Selected a documentation-only first batch covering PRD 01 US-001 through US-004 because it has no code dependencies and establishes V1 guardrails before storage/runtime work.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 01 documentation batch draft: added `docs/specs/capabilities/runtime-observability-telemetry.md`, updated `docs/specs/capabilities/debug-cli.md` with the planned `pibo debug telemetry` branch, and expanded the telemetry PRD README with execution readiness notes plus rollout checklist.
- 2026-05-16: Validation passed for PRD 01 docs batch with `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run typecheck'`.
- 2026-05-16: Re-ran `npm run typecheck` in the Docker worker after final documentation cleanup; validation still passed.
- 2026-05-16: Committed PRD 01 documentation batch with message `Document telemetry V1 guardrails PRD01`.

- 2026-05-16: Started new Ralph run. Reviewed recent commits/status (HEAD 0475c87, clean), glossary, progress file, all change specs/PRD markdown, and all PRD JSONs. Selected PRD 02 storage foundation batch (US-001 through US-003 initially, extending only if cohesive): shared types, additive telemetry schema, and best-effort typed write APIs; defer CLI/read/stale/runtime capture to later dependent batches.

- 2026-05-16: Inspected data store seams (`src/data/schema.ts`, `src/data/pibo-store.ts`, existing event/payload/session stores, and data-v2 tests). Implementation plan: add `src/data/telemetry.ts`, wire it into `PiboDataStore`, add additive telemetry tables/indexes to `applyPiboDataSchema`, and add store contract tests before validating in the Docker worker.

- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 02 storage foundation draft: telemetry record types, additive pibo.sqlite tables/indexes, PiboDataStore telemetry seam, typed upsert/write methods, best-effort wrapper, provider event counters, tool-call progress rows, and preview-disabled read contract. Added `test/telemetry-store.test.mjs` for schema idempotency and write contracts. Beginning Docker validation.

- 2026-05-16: Full Docker validation passed for PRD 02 storage foundation: `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry bash -lc "cd /workspace && npm test"` completed with 402 passing tests. Marked PRD 02 US-001 through US-003 as passing in JSON and checked tasks 2.1/2.2. Remaining PRD 02 work: bounded read APIs, centralized volume-control helper, complete preview optional contract, stats/prune.

- 2026-05-16: Reloaded the Docker dev gateway inside `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry` after code changes and verified health with `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat >/dev/null` after the build/gateway came up.

- 2026-05-16: Committed PRD 02 storage foundation batch with message `Implement telemetry store foundation PRD02 US-001-US-003`.

- 2026-05-16: Started next Ralph run from clean HEAD `24935bb`. Reviewed required git history/status, glossary, progress, change specs, PRD markdown/JSONs. Selected a cohesive remaining PRD 02 batch: US-004 through US-007 (bounded read APIs, volume-control helper, preview-disabled contract hardening, stats/prune service) because PRD 04 CLI depends on these storage read seams.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented first PRD 02 US-004/US-005/US-007 storage read-service draft in `src/data/telemetry.ts`: bounded session/session-detail/turn/provider-event-page/stale read APIs, centralized bounded preview and safe-field helpers, and telemetry stats/prune dry-run/apply service. Docker `npm run typecheck` passed after the draft. Adding focused store contract tests next.
- 2026-05-16: Completed PRD 02 US-004 through US-007 implementation and validation: bounded read APIs, provider-event cursor pages, stale read, volume-control helpers, preview-disabled contract hardening, stats, dry-run/apply prune, and focused tests. Docker `npm test` passed with 406 tests. Marked PRD 02 US-004-US-007 as passing and checked tasks 2.3-2.5 plus validation task 6.1. Reloading Docker gateway next.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker dev gateway inside `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry` after the PRD 02 read/retention code changes and verified Chat Web health at `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Final validation after UTF-8 truncation hardening passed in Docker worker: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` (406 passing tests).
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker dev gateway again after final validation/build and verified Chat Web health at `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`. Ready to commit PRD 02 US-004-US-007.
- 2026-05-16: Committed PRD 02 read/retention batch with message `Implement telemetry read APIs PRD02 US-004-US-007`. PRD 02 is now fully passing; next coherent work starts PRD 03 runtime/provider/tool capture or PRD 04 CLI on top of the read APIs.

- 2026-05-16: Started next Ralph run from clean HEAD `14e177a`. Reviewed required git history/status, glossary, progress, telemetry change specs/design/tasks/decisions, and all PRD JSONs. Selected PRD 03 US-001 as the next dependency-ordered coherent batch: default-on best-effort runtime queue/turn lifecycle telemetry in the routed session path. Deferring deeper provider stream parser and debug CLI work to later batches.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 03 US-001 draft: added a best-effort runtime telemetry recorder, wired `PiboSessionRouter` to the pibo.sqlite telemetry store exposed by `PiboDataSessionStore`, and added focused lifecycle tests for queued/start/ok, error, and abort outcomes. Docker `npm run typecheck` passed after the draft.
- 2026-05-16: Full Docker validation passed for PRD 03 US-001 runtime queue/turn lifecycle batch: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` (409 passing tests). Marked PRD 03 US-001 as complete/pass in the JSON and checked task 3.1.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker dev gateway inside `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry` after the runtime telemetry changes and verified Chat Web health at `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Committed PRD 03 US-001 runtime lifecycle telemetry batch with message `Implement runtime lifecycle telemetry PRD03 US-001`. Next runtime work should continue with PRD 03 US-002 phase transitions from normalized events, then provider/tool capture stories.

- 2026-05-16: Started new Ralph run from HEAD `95cb54c`. Reviewed required git history/status, glossary, progress file, telemetry change docs, Markdown PRDs, and all PRD JSONs. Selected PRD 03 US-002 as the next dependency-ordered coherent batch: explicit phase transitions derived from normalized runtime events. PRD 03 provider stream parser and tool-call/tool-execution row capture remain deferred to later batches.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 03 US-002 draft in `src/core/runtime-telemetry.ts`: normalized assistant, reasoning, tool-call, and tool-execution events now create/update/finish metadata-only phase rows; provider-stream progress is inferred from normalized provider-origin events; terminal turn outcomes close open phases. Added focused runtime telemetry tests for assistant/reasoning, partial tool args, tool execution, and error phase sequences.
- 2026-05-16: Docker `npm run typecheck` initially failed because best-effort phase upsert can return undefined; hardened the args-complete close path to tolerate unavailable telemetry writes before re-running validation.
- 2026-05-16: Docker validation passed for PRD 03 US-002: `npm run typecheck` and full `npm test` (412 passing tests). Marked PRD 03 US-002 complete/pass in JSON and checked task 3.2. Next PRD 03 work should proceed to provider request lifecycle capture (US-003) and provider event metadata (US-004).
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker dev gateway inside `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry` after PRD 03 US-002 changes and verified Chat Web health at `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Committed PRD 03 US-002 runtime phase telemetry batch with message `Implement runtime phase telemetry PRD03 US-002`.

- 2026-05-16: Started new Ralph run from HEAD `49a5415`. Reviewed required git history/status, glossary, progress file, telemetry source docs, Markdown PRDs, and all PRD JSONs. Selected PRD 03 US-003 as the next dependency-ordered coherent batch: provider request lifecycle capture using Pibo-owned Pi extension hooks (`before_provider_request`/`after_provider_response`) plus runtime terminal/normalized-event correlation. Provider raw event metadata (US-004) and tool-call rows (US-005/US-006) remain deferred.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 03 US-003 draft: added `src/core/provider-telemetry.ts` using Pibo-owned Pi extension hooks for provider request start/response capture, wired the extension into `PiboSessionRouter`, and extended runtime telemetry to correlate normalized progress and terminal outcomes back to active provider requests. Added focused tests for completed, aborted, errored, no-first-byte, and partial/still-open provider request states.
- 2026-05-16: Docker validation passed for PRD 03 US-003 provider lifecycle capture: `npm run typecheck` and full `npm test` (417 passing tests). Marked PRD 03 US-003 complete/pass in JSON and checked task 3.3. Remaining PRD 03 work starts with provider event metadata/raw parser counters (US-004), then tool-call argument/execution rows (US-005/US-006) and the incident fixture (US-007).
- 2026-05-16: Host did not have `python`; used `node` instead to update PRD 03 US-003 JSON status/pass fields and `tasks.md` after validation.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker dev gateway inside `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry` after PRD 03 US-003 changes and verified Chat Web health at `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Ready to commit PRD 03 US-003 provider request lifecycle telemetry batch after successful Docker validation and gateway health check.

- 2026-05-16: Started new Ralph run from HEAD `63cfe42`. Reviewed required git history/status, glossary, progress file, telemetry proposal/spec/design/tasks/decisions, Markdown PRD set, and all PRD JSONs. Selected PRD 03 US-004 as the next dependency-ordered coherent batch: bounded provider event metadata/counters through Pibo-owned runtime/provider telemetry seams. Direct raw OpenAI SSE hooks are not exposed by the current Pi extension API, so this batch will avoid `node_modules` edits and capture metadata from Pi parsed assistant stream events plus store-level parse/unknown event counters for future parser seams.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 03 US-004 provider event metadata draft: added bounded Pi assistant stream event metadata capture via `PiboRuntimeTelemetryRecorder.recordPiEvent`, wired it from `RoutedSession`/`PiboSessionRouter`, added safe structural fields and upstream response id linking, and extended provider-event writes with `normalizedEventDelta` so metadata rows can reference normalized types without double-counting normalized output events.
- 2026-05-16: Validation passed for PRD 03 US-004 focused checks: Docker `npm run typecheck`; Docker build plus `node --test test/runtime-telemetry.test.mjs test/telemetry-store.test.mjs` (22 passing tests). Full Docker `npm test` then passed with 418 tests.
- 2026-05-16: Marked PRD 03 US-004 complete/pass in JSON and checked tasks 3.4/3.5. Remaining PRD 03 work: tool-call argument progress (US-005), tool execution lifecycle rows (US-006), and stuck tool-call fixture (US-007).
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker dev gateway inside `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry` after PRD 03 US-004 changes and verified Chat Web health at `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Committed PRD 03 US-004 provider event metadata batch with message `Implement provider event telemetry PRD03 US-004`.

- 2026-05-16: Started new Ralph run from HEAD `9fc2fab`. Reviewed required git history/status, glossary, progress file, telemetry proposal/spec/design/tasks/decisions, Markdown PRDs, and all PRD JSONs. Selected a cohesive PRD 03 tool telemetry batch: US-005 tool-call argument progress and US-006 tool execution lifecycle, because both share the normalized tool event capture path and telemetry_tool_calls store API. PRD 03 US-007 incident fixture remains deferred unless this batch completes cleanly.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 03 US-005/US-006 draft in `src/core/runtime-telemetry.ts`: normalized and Pi tool-call events now upsert metadata-only tool-call rows with args byte counts, parse status, safe top-level keys, provider item/request links, and execution lifecycle status/timestamps/error summaries. Added focused runtime telemetry tests for empty/partial/invalid/valid/complete args, successful and failed tool execution, and aborting a started-without-finish execution. First Docker `npm run typecheck` caught a provider request id variable typo; fixed and re-running validation.
- 2026-05-16: Docker validation passed for the PRD 03 US-005/US-006 draft with `npm run typecheck` and focused `npm run build && node --test test/runtime-telemetry.test.mjs test/telemetry-store.test.mjs` (25 passing tests). Running full Docker `npm test` next.
- 2026-05-16: Full Docker validation passed for PRD 03 US-005/US-006 tool telemetry batch: `npm run typecheck`, focused build plus runtime/store telemetry tests (25 passing), and full `npm test` (421 passing tests). Marked PRD 03 US-005 and US-006 complete/pass in JSON and checked tasks 3.6/3.7. Remaining PRD 03 work is US-007 synthetic stuck tool-call fixture plus broader PRD 05 fixtures/CLI/stale work.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker dev gateway inside `pibo-dev-ralph-observability-telemetry` after PRD 03 US-005/US-006 changes and verified Chat Web health at `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Final validation after tool-argument byte-count cleanup passed in Docker worker: `npm run typecheck && npm test` (421 passing tests). Reloading Docker gateway again before commit.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker dev gateway after final validation and verified Chat Web health at `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`. Ready to commit PRD 03 US-005/US-006 tool telemetry batch.
- 2026-05-16: Committed PRD 03 US-005/US-006 tool telemetry batch with message `Implement tool telemetry PRD03 US-005-US-006`.
