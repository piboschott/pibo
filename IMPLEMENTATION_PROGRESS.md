## Operating notes

- Keep implementation work in the dedicated host worktree above.
- Reuse the existing Docker dev worker for runtime, tests, builds, gateway restarts, and browser checks.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless explicitly asked.
- Do not restart or modify host services.
- Run container commands as `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-ink-cli-session-ui bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path.
- Batch user stories sensibly. Stop the session when a coherent batch is complete.
- Commit after each completed story or coherent story group.
- Before starting new work, review recent commits in this worktree/branch.

## Codebase Patterns

- Pending discovery by implementation runs.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-16: Created dedicated worktree and Docker dev worker for Ink CLI Session UI Ralph loop.
- 2026-05-16: Started container gateway/web with `npm run build && /app/scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh gateway:web`; health check passed at `http://127.0.0.1:4812/apps/chat`.

- 2026-05-16: Updated Ralph target to dedicated room `room_0a5d20f1-f368-4020-984f-aa9ce3a603be`; room CWD is the dedicated worktree.
- 2026-05-16: Cleared stale Ralph stop/cancel request flags after retargeting so a future manual start can run normally; job remains stopped.
- 2026-05-16: Started PRD 01 documentation/scope batch (US-001..US-003). Decision inputs: final V1 command `pibo tui:sessions`; Web Chat remains full control center; CLI V1 excludes Projects, Workflows, Cron, Ralph, Agent Designer, full Settings, full context management; `/model`, `/thinking`, `/fork`, and `/details` are later-scope unless separately approved.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 01 docs batch across capability/change/PRD docs: recorded V1 command/scope decisions, local/direct-first source decision, later-scope slash commands, and Web/CLI boundary checklist including existing `pibo tui`/`pibo tui:routed`, renderer dependency hygiene, bounded output, and validation expectations.
- 2026-05-16: Validation for PRD 01: `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-ink-cli-session-ui bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run typecheck'` passed (root, Chat UI, Context Files UI typechecks). Marked `prd_01_product_overview.json` US-001..US-003 `passes: true`.
- 2026-05-16: Created commit `docs: complete ink cli prd 01 scope guardrails` for PRD 01. Next dependency-order target is `prd_02_shared_terminal_view_model.json` US-001 (shared renderer-neutral terminal view-model boundary), then Web migration/tests.
- 2026-05-16: Started PRD 02 shared terminal view-model batch (US-001..US-003). Plan: move compact terminal row/value model to `src/session-ui/`, update Web compact terminal imports to the shared boundary, add deterministic row fixture tests, then run focused test/typecheck in Docker.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 02 US-001/US-002 by moving renderer-neutral compact terminal rows/value helpers to `src/session-ui/`, exporting a shared boundary via `src/session-ui/index.ts`, leaving Web compatibility re-exports, and updating Web compact terminal components to import the shared model directly. Shared source imports only shared trace modules and local helpers; no React DOM, browser, CSS, Virtuoso, lucide, or Ink imports.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 02 US-003 with `test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs`, covering deterministic user/assistant/tool/result/yielded-run/error rows, long text truncation, JSON-like values, empty/missing fields, value helpers, and dependency hygiene for shared modules.
- 2026-05-16: Validation for PRD 02: `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-ink-cli-session-ui bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run typecheck'` passed; first `npm test` exposed a fixture expectation mismatch for user message object output, fixed the test fixture, focused `node --test test/session-ui-terminal-rows.test.mjs` passed, and full `npm test` passed (402 tests). Marked `prd_02_shared_terminal_view_model.json` US-001..US-003 `passes: true`.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker worker gateway with container-only build/start commands after PRD 02; health check passed at `http://127.0.0.1:4812/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Created PRD 02 batch commit `feat: complete prd 02 shared terminal view model`. Next dependency-order target is `prd_03_ink_renderer.json` US-001 (Ink renderer module skeleton/dependency decision), then row rendering/helpers/tests.
- 2026-05-16: Started PRD 03 static Ink renderer batch (US-001..US-004). Plan: add Ink dependency, create `src/apps/cli-ui/` renderer/helper modules over shared compact rows, add deterministic `renderToString()` tests plus dependency guard checks, then run Docker typecheck/full tests before marking PRD 03 stories passed.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 03 US-001 by adding `ink@^7.0.3` via npm in the Docker worker and creating the `src/apps/cli-ui/` Ink renderer module boundary (`InkTerminalView`, `InkTerminalRow`, `InkTerminalLine`, colors, markdown, JSON, index). Renderer imports Ink/React plus shared row types only; no Web DOM, CSS, Virtuoso, lucide, browser markdown, Prism, or JSON-tree dependencies.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 03 US-002/US-003 with a bounded tail-window terminal view, terminal-safe row/status markers, Ink `Box`/`Text` line rendering, plain markdown normalization for paragraphs/lists/links/code fences, bounded JSON pretty printing, inline JSON previews, and missing-field fallbacks.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 03 US-004 with `test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs`, covering Ink `renderToString()` output for user/assistant/tool/yielded-run/error rows, bounded row windows, markdown helper behavior, JSON truncation markers, and dependency hygiene. First full `npm test` exposed two test expectation mismatches; adjusted expectations/helper behavior and focused renderer test passed.
- 2026-05-16: Validation for PRD 03: `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-ink-cli-session-ui bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run typecheck'` passed; focused `node --test test/cli-ui-ink-renderer.test.mjs` passed; full `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-ink-cli-session-ui bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm test'` passed (407 tests). Marked `prd_03_ink_renderer.json` US-001..US-004 `passes: true`.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker worker gateway after PRD 03 via container-only build/start commands. Initial health probe hit a reset while the gateway restarted; follow-up health check passed at `http://127.0.0.1:4812/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Post-cleanup validation: reran `docker exec pibo-dev-ralph-ink-cli-session-ui bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run typecheck'`; it passed.
- 2026-05-16: Created PRD 03 batch commit `feat: complete prd 03 ink renderer`. Next dependency-order target is `prd_04_session_source_runtime_integration.json` US-001 (CliSessionSource interface and fake source), then local source discovery/create/send/live updates.
- 2026-05-16: Ralph stopped accidentally because the final answer in session `ps_58c3e14e-79a3-417a-8893-657e1f5973c8` quoted the promise-complete literal in a negative sentence. Updated the job prompt to remove the contiguous literal marker and added explicit safety instructions: only emit the XML completion marker when all PRD JSON stories are `passes: true`; otherwise write `completion marker omitted`.
- 2026-05-16: Started PRD 04 session source boundary batch (US-001 only). Plan: add renderer-neutral `CliSessionSource` types under `src/cli-session/`, implement deterministic fake source fixtures for later controller/UI tests, add focused tests for rooms/sessions/agents/status/trace updates/cleanup, then run Docker typecheck and focused/full tests before marking US-001 passed.
- 2026-05-16: PRD 04 US-001 first focused validation found the fake trace fixture used identical timestamps, producing order-dependent row output. Adjusted the fixture to use deterministic sequential timestamps before rerunning validation.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 04 US-001 with `src/cli-session/` source boundary exports: `CliSessionSource`, room/session/agent/status/update types, `CliOpenSession`, `CliSourceError`, and deterministic `FakeCliSessionSource`. The fake source supports fixture rooms/sessions/agents/status, opening trace views, creating sessions, sending message updates, applying existing agents, subscription/unsubscription, and idempotent cleanup; it remains free of renderer/Web dependencies.
- 2026-05-16: Added `test/cli-session-source.test.mjs` covering deterministic fake source fixtures, shared compact row compatibility, trace/session update emission, cleanup, session creation, agent selection errors, and dependency hygiene. Validation passed in Docker: `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build && node --test test/cli-session-source.test.mjs`; full `npm test` (412 tests). Marked `prd_04_session_source_runtime_integration.json` US-001 `passes: true` and checked off tasks T3.1. Next dependency-order target is PRD 04 US-002 local/direct session source status and discovery.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker worker gateway after PRD 04 US-001. First combined restart command was terminated during `pkill` and a follow-up health probe reset while no gateway process was active; restarted `/app/scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh gateway:web` in the worker and health check passed at `http://127.0.0.1:4812/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Created PRD 04 US-001 batch commit `feat: add cli session source fake for PRD04 US-001`.
- 2026-05-16: Started PRD 04 US-002 local/direct status and discovery batch. Plan: add `LocalCliSessionSource` skeleton over injectable Pibo session store/optional room provider/plugin registry, map existing Pibo sessions to CLI summaries with secret-redacted status, return clear unsupported errors for not-yet-implemented create/open/send flows, add focused tests with in-memory fixtures, then run Docker typecheck and tests before marking US-002 passed.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 04 US-002 with `LocalCliSessionSource`: default local/direct source over the V2 Pibo data session store, injectable stores for tests, owner-scoped session listing, metadata-derived room discovery, plugin-registry profile/agent summaries, redacted status messages, and clear `unsupported` `CliSourceError`s for create/open/send behavior deferred to US-003.
- 2026-05-16: Added local-source coverage to `test/cli-session-source.test.mjs` for existing session discovery, room derivation, profile listing, status redaction, unsupported state errors, close behavior, and renderer dependency hygiene. Validation passed in Docker: `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build && node --test test/cli-session-source.test.mjs` after fixing the expected built-in profile name; focused `node --test test/cli-session-source.test.mjs`; full `npm test` (415 tests). Marked `prd_04_session_source_runtime_integration.json` US-002 `passes: true`. Next dependency-order target is PRD 04 US-003 local create/open/send flow.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker worker gateway after PRD 04 US-002 with container-only build/start commands. Health probes reset while the gateway restarted, then passed at `http://127.0.0.1:4812/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Cleanup after review: removed unused `cwd` option from the PRD 04 US-002 local source skeleton and reran Docker `npm run typecheck`; it passed.
- 2026-05-16: Created PRD 04 US-002 batch commit `feat: add local cli session discovery for PRD04 US-002`.
- 2026-05-16: Started PRD 04 local create/open/send/live-agent batch (US-003..US-005). Plan: extend `LocalCliSessionSource` beyond discovery with session creation, opening, message traces, local update subscriptions/cleanup, and existing-profile selection for new sessions; validate with focused source tests, typecheck, and full tests before marking stories passed.
- 2026-05-16: Implemented PRD 04 US-003..US-005 in `LocalCliSessionSource`: create sessions with room metadata and selected existing profiles, open current/empty trace views, send local text into compact-row-compatible trace nodes, optionally project injected router live events into trace/session updates, clean open handles/listeners/router/store on close, and return clear source errors for missing sessions, empty messages, missing profiles, send failures, and unsupported existing-session profile changes.
- 2026-05-16: Added local source tests for create/open/send/subscription cleanup, router live event projection, current-session agent-selection limits, and continued renderer dependency hygiene. Validation passed in Docker: `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build && node --test test/cli-session-source.test.mjs` after adjusting profile fixture names to installed profiles; full `npm test` passed (417 tests). Marked `prd_04_session_source_runtime_integration.json` US-003..US-005 `passes: true`. Next dependency-order target is PRD 05 US-001 command registration for `pibo tui:sessions`.
- 2026-05-16: Reloaded Docker worker gateway after PRD 04 US-003..US-005 with container-only build/start commands. First health probe reset during startup; follow-up health check passed at `http://127.0.0.1:4812/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Added default-profile fallback coverage for local source creation so `/new` can create a session when `pibo-agent` is not installed. Reran Docker validation: `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build && node --test test/cli-session-source.test.mjs`; full `npm test` passed (417 tests). Reloaded Docker worker gateway again after the final code tweak; startup health probes reset while the gateway rebuilt, then passed at `http://127.0.0.1:4812/apps/chat`.
- 2026-05-16: Created PRD 04 US-003..US-005 batch commit `feat: complete PRD04 local cli session runtime`; see current commit for the final hash.
