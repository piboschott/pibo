Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Pi Coding Agent
If you have to dig deeper into the Pi Coding Agent: `~/code/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent`

## Rules
Always read `RULES.md`. It contains all relevant rules for development and our project.

## Glossary
Always read `GLOSSARY.md`. It contains a shared vocabulary for our project.

## Session Debugging
When reading Pibo Sessions, use the debug CLI first: `npm run dev -- debug session --help`.

## Frontend Design
If you are doing any frontend design, be sure to read `DESIGN.md`.

## Browser Use
Always use `browser-use` for frontend development. In one persistent terminal, initialize the Browser Use environment once with `eval "$(npm run --silent dev -- tools env browser-use)"`, then run later `browser-use` commands directly from that same terminal. Use `npm run dev -- tools guide browser-use` for the full guide.
For authenticated Pibo Chat Web App browser testing, prefer an isolated Browser Use lease so parallel agents do not share tabs or element indices:
`eval "$(npm run --silent dev -- tools browser-use lease acquire --app pibo-chat --owner "$USER")"`.
The lease sets `PIBO_BROWSER_USE_SESSION`, so later `browser-use` commands in that shell use the leased session by default. Use `browser-use --session pibo-auth state` only as a legacy fallback when a lease is unavailable.
