## Scope

Improve maintainability through safe, reviewable code-quality work. Focus mainly on overloaded files and unclear responsibility boundaries, but also address adjacent issues when they are higher-value: module/class boundaries, naming consistency, duplicated logic, brittle architecture, missing tests around risky seams, and analysis that identifies the next best refactor.

Initial high-priority candidates from line-count scan:

- `src/apps/chat/web-app.ts` (~11,096 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/App.tsx` (~10,189 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/WorkflowsArea.tsx` (~4,513 LOC)
- `src/debug/web.ts` (~4,456 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/runtime/index.ts` (~3,909 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/store/index.ts` (~2,109 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/index.ts` (~1,909 LOC)
- `src/shared/trace-engine.ts` (~1,797 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/api.ts` (~1,667 LOC)
- `src/data/telemetry.ts` (~1,576 LOC)

## Acceptance criteria

- Refactor or analyze only when it improves maintainability or identifies a concrete safer next step.
- Prefer files below 1,000 LOC; for very large legacy files, make steady, behavior-preserving reductions without risky big-bang rewrites.
- Valid batches include implementation refactors, naming/convention cleanup, test-safety batches, and analysis-only batches with useful committed findings.
- Preserve behavior and public APIs unless a change is necessary and covered by tests.
- All relevant tests continue to pass.
- Run `npm run typecheck` for completed refactoring batches.
- Run focused tests for touched areas.
- For user-facing Web/CLI/runtime changes, perform a manual end-to-end check in the Docker dev worker and record evidence.
- Commit each successful coherent batch from the host worktree.

## Operating notes

- Work only in the dedicated host worktree: `/root/code/pibo/.worktrees/refactor-responsibility-ralph`.
- Use the Docker dev worker for runtime, tests, builds, gateway restarts, and browser checks.
- Run container commands as: `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless explicitly asked.
- Do not restart or modify host services such as `pibo-web.service`.
- Do not deploy to dev or production.
- Keep `RESPONSIBILITY_REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md` short, current, and precise.
- Keep durable learnings, architecture observations, validation notes, and gotchas in `RESPONSIBILITY_REFACTOR_INSIGHTS.md`.

## Current state

- Last batch: Extracted the cohesive Chat UI Workflow API client seam from `src/apps/chat-ui/src/api.ts` into `src/apps/chat-ui/src/api-workflows.ts`.
- Result: `WorkflowsArea.tsx` and the project workflow creation/start call sites in `App.tsx` now import workflow client functions and types directly from the focused module, while `api.ts` re-exports the module for compatibility. `api.ts` dropped from 1,415 LOC to 868 LOC.
- Validation: `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace && test -f src/apps/chat-ui/src/api-workflows.ts && grep -R "api-workflows" src/apps/chat-ui/src/App.tsx src/apps/chat-ui/src/WorkflowsArea.tsx && ! grep -E "getWorkflowVersionPicker|postProjectWorkflowSession|postProjectWorkflowSessionStart" src/apps/chat-ui/src/api.ts && npm run build && npm run typecheck'` passed (source sanity check, root build, root typecheck). No browser/manual check was needed because this was a pure client module extraction with preserved request paths and exported names.
- Commit: `63bd1ac` (`refactor(chat-ui): extract workflow api client`).
- Blockers: none.
- Exact next step: Continue the Chat UI API boundary by extracting another cohesive request family from `src/apps/chat-ui/src/api.ts`, likely prompt/settings, agent-designer capability management, or room/session messaging APIs, with direct imports at owning UI call sites and compatibility re-exports from `api.ts`.

## Progress log
