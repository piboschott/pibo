## Scope

Improve maintainability through safe, reviewable code-quality work. Focus mainly on overloaded files and unclear responsibility boundaries, but also address adjacent issues when they are higher-value: module/class boundaries, naming consistency, duplicated logic, brittle architecture, missing tests around risky seams, and analysis that identifies the next best refactor.

Initial high-priority candidates from line-count scan:

- `src/apps/chat/web-app.ts` (~11,096 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/App.tsx` (~10,189 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/WorkflowsArea.tsx` (~4,513 LOC)
- `src/debug/web.ts` (~4,456 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/runtime/index.ts` (~3,909 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/store/index.ts` (~2,109 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/index.ts` (~1,909 LOC)
- `src/shared/trace-engine.ts` (~1,797 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/api.ts` (~1,667 LOC)
- `src/data/telemetry.ts` (~1,576 LOC)

## Acceptance criteria

- Refactor or analyze only when it improves maintainability or identifies a concrete safer next step.
- Prefer files below 1,000 LOC; for very large legacy files, make steady, behavior-preserving reductions without risky big-bang rewrites.
- Valid batches include implementation refactors, naming/convention cleanup, test-safety batches, and analysis-only batches with useful committed findings.
- Preserve behavior and public APIs unless a change is necessary and covered by tests.
- All relevant tests continue to pass.
- Run `npm run typecheck` for completed refactoring batches.
- Run focused tests for touched areas.
- For user-facing Web/CLI/runtime changes, perform a manual end-to-end check in the Docker dev worker and record evidence.
- Commit each successful coherent batch from the host worktree.

## Operating notes

- Work only in the dedicated host worktree: `/root/code/pibo/.worktrees/refactor-responsibility-ralph`.
- Use the Docker dev worker for runtime, tests, builds, gateway restarts, and browser checks.
- Run container commands as: `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless explicitly asked.
- Do not restart or modify host services such as `pibo-web.service`.
- Do not deploy to dev or production.
- Keep `RESPONSIBILITY_REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md` short, current, and precise.
- Keep durable learnings, architecture observations, validation notes, and gotchas in `RESPONSIBILITY_REFACTOR_INSIGHTS.md`.

## Current state

- Last batch: Extracted workflow code node dispatch types/functions into `packages/workflows/src/runtime/code-node.ts`, preserving the public `runtime/index.ts` export surface through re-exports.
- Result: `runtime/index.ts` is down from 1,037 to 753 LOC; code node handler resolution, scoped state/edge readers, command collection/emission, patch validation/application, output validation, event persistence, and code-handler error summarization now live in a focused runtime module.
- Validation: `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace/packages/workflows && npm test -- src/testing/runtime-code-node.test.ts'` passed; `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace/packages/workflows && npm test'` passed (138 passing); `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run typecheck'` passed. Closest practical runtime E2E is workflow package coverage for code-node dispatch plus mixed code/agent/human/adapter/nested workflow execution.
- Commit: pending this run (`refactor(workflows): extract code node runtime`).
- Blockers: none.
- Exact next step: Continue `packages/workflows/src/runtime/index.ts` by extracting nested workflow node dispatch into `packages/workflows/src/runtime/nested-workflow-node.ts`; existing nested workflow and mixed workflow tests cover registered child execution, missing child refs, incomplete child runs, child output validation, and persistence-adjacent behavior.

## Progress log

- 2026-05-26: Prepared dedicated upstream/dev-based worktree, Docker dev worker, Ralph room, tracking files, and stopped Ralph job `ralph_08b432d8-b80f-49b2-bd25-da1c84cfc16e` with only `max-iterations=200` as stop condition.
- 2026-05-26: Tightened Ralph prompt to broaden scope from responsibility-only refactoring to code-quality refactoring/analysis, require reading progress/insights and git history at run start, and allow analysis, naming, boundary, test-safety, and architecture-cleanup batches.
