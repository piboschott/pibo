## Scope

Improve maintainability through safe, reviewable code-quality work. Focus mainly on overloaded files and unclear responsibility boundaries, but also address adjacent issues when they are higher-value: module/class boundaries, naming consistency, duplicated logic, brittle architecture, missing tests around risky seams, and analysis that identifies the next best refactor.

Initial high-priority candidates from line-count scan:

- `src/apps/chat/web-app.ts` (~11,096 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/App.tsx` (~10,189 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/WorkflowsArea.tsx` (~4,513 LOC)
- `src/debug/web.ts` (~4,456 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/runtime/index.ts` (~3,909 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/store/index.ts` (~2,109 LOC)
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/index.ts` (~1,909 LOC)
- `src/shared/trace-engine.ts` (~1,797 LOC)
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/api.ts` (~1,667 LOC)
- `src/data/telemetry.ts` (~1,576 LOC)

## Acceptance criteria

- Refactor or analyze only when it improves maintainability or identifies a concrete safer next step.
- Prefer files below 1,000 LOC; for very large legacy files, make steady, behavior-preserving reductions without risky big-bang rewrites.
- Valid batches include implementation refactors, naming/convention cleanup, test-safety batches, and analysis-only batches with useful committed findings.
- Preserve behavior and public APIs unless a change is necessary and covered by tests.
- All relevant tests continue to pass.
- Run `npm run typecheck` for completed refactoring batches.
- Run focused tests for touched areas.
- For user-facing Web/CLI/runtime changes, perform a manual end-to-end check in the Docker dev worker and record evidence.
- Commit each successful coherent batch from the host worktree.

## Operating notes

- Work only in the dedicated host worktree: `/root/code/pibo/.worktrees/refactor-responsibility-ralph`.
- Use the Docker dev worker for runtime, tests, builds, gateway restarts, and browser checks.
- Run container commands as: `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace && <command>'`.
- Git operations and commits must be done on the host worktree path.
- Do not create or release Docker workers unless explicitly asked.
- Do not restart or modify host services such as `pibo-web.service`.
- Do not deploy to dev or production.
- Keep `RESPONSIBILITY_REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md` short, current, and precise.
- Keep durable learnings, architecture observations, validation notes, and gotchas in `RESPONSIBILITY_REFACTOR_INSIGHTS.md`.

## Current state

- Last batch: Extracted the Project workflow create/start panels and their diagnostics/summary helpers from `src/apps/chat-ui/src/App.tsx` into `src/apps/chat-ui/src/projects/ProjectWorkflowPanels.tsx` while keeping `ProjectsArea` orchestration and project workflow API calls in `App.tsx`.
- Result: `App.tsx` now delegates project workflow panel rendering, workflow picker option keying, and workflow diagnostic extraction to the projects module, and fell from 5,929 LOC to 5,638 LOC. The extracted `ProjectWorkflowPanels.tsx` is 303 LOC.
- Evidence: source sanity check confirmed `App.tsx` imports `ConfiguredWorkflowStartPanel`, `ProjectWorkflowSessionCreatePanel`, `workflowDiagnosticsFromError`, and `workflowVersionOptionKey` from `./projects/ProjectWorkflowPanels`; `wc -l` reports 5,638 LOC for `App.tsx` and 303 LOC for the new panel module.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed; Docker source/import sanity check passed; `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run chat-ui:typecheck'` passed; `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace && npm run typecheck'` passed. Worker route smoke `docker exec pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph bash -lc 'cd /workspace && curl --max-time 5 -S -s -o /tmp/pibo-chat-smoke.out -w "HTTP %{http_code}\\n" http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat || true'` returned `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 4802` and HTTP 000, so no browser validation was possible without restarting worker services.
- Commit: pending.
- Blockers: worker Chat Web server on port 4802 is still not serving the route during smoke validation; no restart performed per operating rules.
- Exact next step: Either extract the remaining `ProjectsArea` orchestration into `projects/ProjectsArea.tsx` now that its sidebar and workflow panels are module-owned, or do a test-safety batch for `SessionTracePane` before extracting live trace/web-annotation hooks.
