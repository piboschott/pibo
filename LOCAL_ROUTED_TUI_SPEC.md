# Local Routed TUI Spec

This document describes a local native-feeling Pibo TUI that uses the same routed runtime as the gateway, web channel, and future channels.

The local TUI is an optional adapter. It must not become a required product path, a hidden daemon, or a second place where Pibo runtime behavior is implemented.

## Goal

Pibo should be usable directly over SSH with a native terminal workflow:

```text
pibo tui:routed <profile>
```

When the selected profile contains Pibo capabilities such as plugin tools, skills, subagents, or yielded runs, the TUI should still expose those capabilities without requiring a separate gateway process.

The user experience should feel local and direct. The architecture should stay routed.

The existing gateway and web paths remain the primary product surfaces. The local routed TUI is a convenience path for local development and operator workflows.

## Core Idea

The local TUI is a channel adapter, not a second runtime.

```text
Pi TUI shell
  -> local routed TUI extension
  -> PiboSessionRouter
  -> RoutedSession
  -> createPiboRuntime(profile, router controllers)
  -> Pi Coding Agent
```

The TUI only handles terminal input and rendering. It does not own tools, subagents, yielded runs, profile resolution, session bindings, or plugin behavior.

## Why Routing Is Required

Generated Pibo tools are not only static tool definitions. They depend on runtime state owned by `PiboSessionRouter`:

- parent and child `sessionKey` ownership
- subagent session creation and reuse
- run registry state
- tracked vs detached completion policy
- run completion notifications
- `pibo_run_read`, `pibo_run_ack`, `pibo_run_cancel`, and bounded waits
- cleanup when sessions or routers are disposed

A direct `createPiboRuntime` call can expose ordinary profile tools, but it cannot safely implement routed subagents and yielded runs unless the router controllers are provided.

The local TUI should therefore use an in-process router instead of duplicating router logic.

## Non-Goals

- Do not replace the existing gateway.
- Do not duplicate subagent or run-registry logic inside the TUI.
- Do not make Pi TUI the owner of Pibo plugin behavior.
- Do not reimplement Pi Coding Agent's session storage or model loop.
- Do not add a large UI framework or long-lived daemon for local use.
- Do not make local TUI behavior required for gateway, web, plugins, or profile development.
- Do not introduce a local TUI-specific tool catalog, profile format, run registry, or subagent manager.

## Plugin Compatibility

The local routed TUI must consume capabilities through the existing plugin and profile path:

```text
PiboPluginRegistry
  -> profile
  -> tools
  -> skills
  -> context files
  -> subagents
  -> registered execution actions where applicable
  -> PiboSessionRouter
```

This means normal plugin additions should automatically work in local TUI mode:

- new tools become visible when the selected profile enables them
- new skills load through the profile
- new context files load through the profile
- new subagents become generated tools
- yielded run tools appear when the profile has yieldable work
- event listeners still receive routed output events

The local TUI must not maintain its own tool catalog. It should only pass a selected profile into the router and render the router's normalized output events.

## CLI Behavior

V1 behavior:

```text
pibo tui:routed <profile>
```

This command always uses the local routed path. It is explicit so the existing `pibo tui <profile>` behavior stays stable while the local adapter is validated.

Existing behavior:

```text
pibo tui <profile>
```

This command may continue to use the direct Pi TUI path for profiles that do not need routed-only capabilities.

Later, `pibo tui <profile>` may auto-select routed mode only when a profile cannot work correctly in direct mode. That follow-up should happen after the explicit routed command is stable and covered by tests.

CLI discovery must stay compact and iterative. The top-level command should only show the immediate command surface; detailed local TUI behavior belongs behind command help or a dedicated guide if it becomes necessary.

## Runtime Behavior

On startup:

1. Create a `PiboSessionRouter` in the current process.
2. Resolve the selected profile through the normal plugin registry.
3. Start a small Pi TUI controller profile with builtin tools disabled.
4. Register a TUI extension that intercepts user input.
5. Forward normal input to `router.emit({ type: "message", sessionKey, text })`.
6. Subscribe to router output events and render them in the TUI.

The local routed TUI should use a stable namespaced session key that includes the selected profile:

```text
local-tui:<profile>:default
```

If profile/session selection is later added, the session key can include a user-provided name:

```text
local-tui:<profile>:<sessionName>
```

This avoids accidentally reusing a binding created for a different profile.

V1 should prefer in-memory session bindings unless persistence is explicitly required. If persistent local TUI bindings are added later, they must use the `local-tui` channel namespace and must not share ambiguous `runtime` bindings with unrelated router uses.

## Event Flow

```text
User enters message
  -> TUI extension handles input
  -> router.emit(message)
  -> routed parent session runs
  -> parent may call pibo_run_start
  -> router starts child session
  -> parent continues or ends turn
  -> child completes
  -> router sends compact run notification
  -> parent can call pibo_run_read
  -> TUI renders assistant output
```

The local TUI should render router events, not raw child implementation details.

## Slash Commands

Pi TUI already owns local slash commands such as settings, model selection, import/export, session navigation, and quit.

The local routed TUI should start with a conservative rule:

- ordinary text goes to the routed Pibo session
- only truly controller-local commands stay local
- commands that sound like session operations must not silently act on the controller shell when the user expects the routed Pibo session
- Pibo execution actions can be exposed only when they do not conflict with Pi TUI built-ins

This mirrors the existing remote-controller approach, where controller-local commands and routed commands are kept separate.

V1 should keep this minimal. `/quit` can stay local. Pibo execution actions can be registered as routed commands only after conflict filtering. Ambiguous Pi TUI session commands such as fork, clone, tree, session, compact, reload, and new should not be advertised as local commands in routed mode unless the UI makes their target explicit.

Pi handles built-in slash commands before extension `input` handlers. To enforce this boundary without changing Pi, the local routed extension should install a narrow submit guard through the extension UI terminal-input hook. The guard should run only for submit keys, inspect only the current editor text, and consume the submit only when the trimmed text begins with a blocked command. A command name appearing later in ordinary prose must remain a normal routed message.

## Lifecycle

The local routed TUI owns the in-process router lifetime.

On TUI shutdown:

- unsubscribe from router events
- dispose the router
- cancel owned running runs through existing router cleanup
- release the controller runtime

The implementation should not leave background subagent runs alive after the local TUI exits.

Router cleanup must be owned by the local routed entry point with a `finally` path. Extension-level shutdown hooks are useful, but they are not the only cleanup boundary.

## Implementation Shape

Minimal implementation:

- add a `runLocalRoutedTui` entry point
- create an in-process `PiboSessionRouter`
- use a small local client that calls `router.emit` directly
- keep TUI input interception and event rendering inside the local adapter
- add the explicit `pibo tui:routed` CLI command
- leave `pibo tui` direct-mode behavior unchanged in V1

Cleaner follow-up:

- consider conservative auto-routing in `pibo tui` only after the explicit path is stable
- keep transport-specific code small

## Acceptance Criteria

- `pibo tui pibo-minimal` still works.
- `pibo tui:routed run-yield-qa` starts without requiring `pibo gateway`.
- The agent sees generated subagent and run-control tools for routed profiles.
- A tracked yielded subagent run can complete after the parent turn and notify the parent.
- `pibo_run_read` returns the completed result.
- A detached run does not automatically re-prompt the parent.
- New profile tools and skills registered through plugins are visible without local TUI-specific code.
- TUI shutdown disposes the router and does not leave running child sessions unmanaged.
- Gateway, web gateway, profile inspection, and direct `pibo tui` behavior do not depend on the local routed TUI module.

## Risks

- Some Pi TUI slash commands act on the controller shell, not the routed Pibo session.
- Rendering streamed output and execution results needs to stay compact.
- Persistent bindings can accidentally pin a session key to an older profile if the local TUI uses an ambiguous key.
- If future plugins require custom terminal UI panels, Pibo will need a small UI extension boundary.
- If subagent or run logic is ever copied into the TUI, gateway and local TUI behavior will drift.

## Decision

Build local native use as an explicit routed TUI adapter.

Do not make direct `createPiboRuntime` responsible for subagents or yielded runs by itself. The router remains the source of truth for Pibo runtime behavior, while the local TUI becomes another channel into that runtime.

V1 should be opt-in through `pibo tui:routed`. If this path proves stable and low-maintenance, `pibo tui` can later auto-select it for profiles that require routed-only capabilities.
