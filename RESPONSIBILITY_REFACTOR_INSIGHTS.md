# Code Quality Refactoring Insights

## Durable context

- The loop targets broad codebase maintainability, not only `src/apps/chat-ui/src/App.tsx` and not only responsibility splitting.
- Valid work includes implementation refactors, analysis-only target discovery, class/module boundary improvements, naming consistency, test-safety batches, duplication reduction, and small architecture cleanup.
- Large-file line count is only a heuristic. Refactor where responsibilities are separable and tests/manual checks can protect behavior.
- Avoid mechanical splitting that creates worse coupling. Each extraction should have a named responsibility and clear call sites.
- Prefer incremental, behavior-preserving moves: extract types, helpers, service modules, hooks/components, or focused API adapters before changing behavior.
- Use existing project style and naming. Do not add speculative frameworks or abstractions.
- At run start, always read the progress file, this insights file, and recent git history before choosing the next batch.

## Environment reminders

- Host worktree: `/root/code/pibo/.worktrees/refactor-responsibility-ralph`
- Container workspace: `/workspace`
- Docker worker: `pibo-dev-refactor-responsibility-ralph`
- Docker image: `pibo:latest`
- Web URL for manual checks: `http://127.0.0.1:4802/apps/chat`
- CDP port: `4801`
- Gateway port: `4800`

## Validation strategy

- Always inspect current tests near the touched code before moving code.
- For pure extraction, focused unit/type checks may be enough for the batch, but still run `npm run typecheck` before commit.
- For Chat Web UI or server behavior, run a Docker-hosted manual path and record the route, observable result, and any screenshot/log path if available.
- If full `npm test` is too expensive for every small batch, run focused tests plus typecheck, then run broader tests after several coherent commits or before handoff.
- The repo root is not configured as an npm workspace for `packages/workflows`; run focused workflow tests with `cd /workspace/packages/workflows && npm test` inside the Docker worker.

## Initial large-file candidates

- `src/apps/chat/web-app.ts`: server/API/session/room/Ralph/cron/web app responsibilities are mixed in one very large module.
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/App.tsx`: likely combines routing, state orchestration, panels, session handling, and UI components.
- `src/apps/chat-ui/src/WorkflowsArea.tsx`: likely a focused feature area but still large enough for component/hook extraction.
- `src/debug/web.ts`: debug CLI/browser/render logic may be separable by command or renderer.
- `packages/workflows/src/runtime/index.ts`: runtime orchestration may need careful test-backed extraction.

## Workflow validation seams

- `packages/workflows/src/validation/json-schema.ts` now owns the pure JSON Schema subset/value validation seam: schema keyword/type checks, object/array/ref/anyOf validation, runtime JSON value checks, local `$defs` refs, and semantic schema equality for port compatibility.
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/registry-refs.ts` now owns workflow registry-reference validation: guard refs (including loop policy guard validation), agent profile selection/archive checks, prompt builder refs, code handler refs, adapter refs, human action refs, adapter-ref shape detection, and `WorkflowValidationOptions`.
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/state-access.ts` now owns workflow state access validation: node `state.reads`/`state.writes` declaration shape checks, scoped state path parsing, edge write rejection, unknown global state path diagnostics, and ambiguous concurrent global write detection.
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/graph-ports.ts` now owns direct workflow port compatibility and graph compatibility diagnostics for direct edges and edge-adapter outputs. It preserves the public `areWorkflowPortsDirectlyCompatible` export through `validation/index.ts`.
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/retry-policy.ts` now owns workflow/node retry policy validation: positive `maxAttempts`, backoff object/kind checks, non-negative delay/max bounds, exponential factor bounds, and `retryOn` array/string diagnostics. The existing invalid retry policy test in `packages/workflows/src/testing/validation.test.ts` covers this seam.
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/graph-cycles.ts` now owns loop/cycle graph validation: loop policy edge/maxAttempts checks, loop/edge guard ref validation, bounded loop edge collection, and unbounded cycle traversal diagnostics. Existing bounded review-loop, missing loop policy, missing guard, unknown guard, and free-cycle tests in `packages/workflows/src/testing/validation.test.ts` cover this seam.
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/graph-edges.ts` now owns structural edge graph validation: source/target node references and edge adapter transform refs/registry existence. Existing missing node, invalid adapter ref, and unknown adapter registry tests in `packages/workflows/src/testing/validation.test.ts` and registry tests cover this seam.
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/schema-declarations.ts` now owns authored schema declaration validation: workflow/node/edge-adapter ports, human node response schemas, and global state field schemas. `validateWorkflowPort` remains a public export from `validation/index.ts` via re-export, so runtime and tests keep the same import surface.
- `packages/workflows/src/validation/index.ts` is now a smaller orchestration/public validation entry point plus runtime value validation helpers and delegation to focused workflow validation modules. Further splitting this file has diminishing returns; the next higher-value workflow seam is likely `packages/workflows/src/runtime/index.ts`, but it should start with analysis or focused tests because dispatch/runtime behavior is broader and riskier than pure validation.

## Workflow runtime seams

- `packages/workflows/src/runtime/retry.ts` now owns workflow node retry policy resolution, retry/exhaustion decisions, scheduled retry attempt cloning, and retry backoff delay calculation. `runtime/index.ts` preserves the public retry helper/type exports via re-export, and the existing `runtime-retry-policy.test.ts` and state-loop integration tests cover this seam.
- `packages/workflows/src/runtime/ids.ts` owns the shared runtime id generation helper used by `runtime/index.ts` and retry scheduling. Keep this small and runtime-specific; avoid turning it into a generic utilities module.
- `packages/workflows/src/runtime/state.ts` now owns runtime state scoping/view helpers, local-state snapshots, declared state readers, code-node patch validation/application, and `WorkflowStateAccessViolation`. Existing code-node, one-node, mixed runtime, state-loop, and persistence tests cover this seam.
- Candidate next runtime seams in `runtime/index.ts`: wait-token expiry/time helpers near the bottom of the file and failure/result builders. Prefer pure helpers with existing tests before extracting dispatch functions.

## Commit policy

- Commit only passing, coherent refactor batches.
- Use concise messages such as `refactor(chat-ui): extract session navigation helpers`.
- Include tracking-file updates in the same commit when they document that batch.
