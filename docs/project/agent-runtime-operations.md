# Agent Runtime Operations

**Updated:** 2026-09-08

This guide covers runtime selection, diagnostics, migration boundaries, private state, and safe troubleshooting for the built-in `pi` and `codex-native` runtimes. Architecture details live in [`architecture/agent-runtime-adapters.md`](./architecture/agent-runtime-adapters.md); exact integrated evidence and the runtime-auth correction are recorded in [`../reports/multi-agent-runtime-adapter-integrated-validation-2026-08-16.md`](../reports/multi-agent-runtime-adapter-integrated-validation-2026-08-16.md) and [`../reports/runtime-auth-control-plane-validation-2026-08-16.md`](../reports/runtime-auth-control-plane-validation-2026-08-16.md).

## Discover runtime support

Start with the profile and product surfaces rather than inspecting adapter files:

```text
pibo profile <profile>
pibo debug session <ps_...>
pibo debug trace <ps_...> --check
```

Agent Designer and authenticated `/api/chat/agent-catalog` expose configured runtime instances, availability, protocol/version diagnostics, model catalogs, option schemas, effective capabilities, and per-runtime provider status. Disabled or degraded controls include an explanation; invalid selections are rejected when the agent is saved and again when a session starts.

Existing Pibo Sessions retain their frozen runtime binding when a profile default changes.

## Inspect a session

Use the Pibo Session id, never a native Pi or Codex id, for product routing:

```text
pibo debug session <ps_...>
pibo debug final <ps_...>
pibo debug trace <ps_...> --check
pibo debug messages <ps_...> list
pibo debug events <ps_...> --limit 20
pibo debug failures <ps_...>
```

The session summary reports:

- configured runtime instance and adapter;
- native session/thread id when present;
- `unbound`, `bound`, `missing`, or `error` state;
- protocol and version;
- binding revision;
- safe metadata keys without values.

Use `pibo debug trace <ps_...> --native-history --check` only when product history is insufficient and an adapter-native compatibility read is required.

## Binding states

- `unbound` — the Pibo Session exists, but the adapter has not durably created or attached its native state.
- `bound` — the native session/thread exists and is attached.
- `missing` — Pibo expected durable native state, but the adapter proved it is absent. Pibo keeps product history and does not create a replacement conversation.
- `error` — the binding cannot be used because of a persistent adapter or migration error.

Binding repair or rebind operations must use the authenticated product API and compare-and-set revision. Do not edit the table manually while the gateway is running.

## Pi runtime

`pi` is the default runtime. Its native id remains the Pi session id, and its resume state remains the Pi JSONL transcript. Compatibility fields and older APIs continue to expose `pi_session_id` during the migration window.

When a Pi session is reported missing:

1. confirm that the binding says native presence was expected;
2. inspect the Pi history provider through runtime-aware debug;
3. distinguish a legitimately disposable empty transcript from a transcript that previously contained turns;
4. repair through the supported binding action only after the missing state is understood.

Do not rename or rewrite legacy Pi transcripts to fit the runtime schema.

## Native Codex runtime

`codex-native` requires an official supported Codex App Server executable. The configured instance reports its validated version range and diagnostics. Pibo starts the App Server with a private Codex home and per-generation environment; it does not scrape terminal output.

Native Codex authentication must be established through the Pibo-managed provider settings control plane. Do not copy a developer's local OAuth files, Pi auth records, browser cookies, or ad hoc access tokens into the runtime home.

## Manage runtime provider authentication

Open the authenticated Chat Web path:

```text
/apps/chat/settings/providers
```

The page groups providers by configured runtime instance. Confirm the target id before changing credentials:

- **Default runtime** marks the runtime selected for new default-profile sessions; it is not a global credential alias.
- **Private account for this configured runtime instance** means login/logout affects only that instance's private store.
- **Shared adapter credential store** currently describes Pi compatibility; another Pi configured instance observes the same Pi provider store.
- Connected, disconnected, pending, partial, unsupported, and failed are explicit states. A missing status is not connected.

The product API is `GET /api/chat/provider-auth` for the catalog and same-origin authenticated `POST /api/chat/provider-auth` for `start`, `api_key`, `complete`, `cancel`, or `logout`. Every mutation includes `runtimeInstanceId` and `providerId`. Provider settings do not require or silently derive an arbitrary Pibo Session id.

Legacy Terminal/TUI `login.*` actions remain session-bound. They target the active session's frozen runtime binding and reject a conflicting explicit runtime target.

For `codex-native`, **Device code** starts official App Server `account/login/start` with `chatgptDeviceCode` in that instance's private `CODEX_HOME`. Open the displayed URL, enter the one-time code, and finish sign-in. Chat Web polls the Pibo flow while the adapter consumes `account/login/completed`; cancellation and timeout close the owned App Server process. API-key setup and logout likewise use stable App Server account methods. Pibo never uses `chatgptAuthTokens`.

After completion, refresh the page and verify safe metadata only: runtime instance, provider, state, account type, and optional plan type. Never inspect or print `auth.json` to prove success.

A fresh native Codex thread may remain live but not durable until its first native turn. After a durable thread exists, a missing rollout is reported as `missing` with a safe conflict response; it is never replaced through `thread/start`.

After interruption or a protocol/process failure, the adapter may recycle the App Server before the next turn. The Pibo Session and native thread binding remain unchanged when resume succeeds.

## Models, reasoning, and approvals

Model and reasoning choices are derived from the runtime's current model catalog. Use only the values advertised for the selected model. Adapter-specific profile options are validated separately from configured-instance operator settings.

Command and file approvals are stable Codex requests. Structured user input is experimental and is disabled unless the configured instance explicitly opts in. Pending requests are scoped to one thread and turn, redacted, bounded, and resolved at most once.

Selected Pibo MCP tools are pre-approved only on the generated credential-allowlisted Pibo server. External MCP servers retain their own native approval behavior. Truthful read-only MCP annotations may allow native policy to execute read-only tools without granting a blanket approval.

## Portable resources

Context Build is the authoritative inspection surface for one session generation. It reports each selected contribution's status, delivery mode, fidelity, and safe target:

- Pi tools compile directly; external harnesses use the session-scoped Pibo MCP bridge.
- Selected external MCP servers must connect and expose their filtered inventory before delivery is reported.
- Selected skills are copied into private roots; unselected skills must not appear.
- Selected context is ordered and delivered through adapter-supported channels without replacing the harness prompt.
- Pibo-managed subagents create child Pibo Sessions with independent bindings.

Generated resource roots live under `$PIBO_HOME/agent-runtimes/`. Directories use mode `0700`; generated files that may contain configuration references use mode `0600`. Cleanup removes generation directories and revokes credentials after router disposal, rebind, or terminal failure.

## Migration and rollback

The current product database schema is additive:

- schema v4 adds `session_runtime_bindings` and backfills existing Pi sessions;
- schema v5 adds runtime-neutral history compatibility metadata.

Before an operator-directed destructive rollback, back up `pibo.sqlite` and payload storage. A previous Pi-only binary can ignore additive runtime rows and continue Pi sessions, but it cannot execute native Codex sessions. Once non-Pi bindings exist, rollback must either retain a runtime-aware binary or explicitly accept that those sessions are unavailable. Never rewrite a Codex binding as Pi.

Useful read-only checks include:

- database `PRAGMA user_version`;
- one binding row per Pibo Session;
- no duplicate `(runtime_adapter_id, native_session_id)` pairs;
- matching Pi compatibility/native ids for Pi bindings;
- no orphan binding rows;
- SQLite integrity check.

## Recover an interrupted durable message queue

Use this workflow when status or Chat Web reports that a previous interrupted message requires review. Do not edit SQLite directly, and do not assume a restart will clear a durable barrier.

1. Inspect both queue layers and the affected Session:

   ```text
   pibo gateway web status
   pibo gateway web doctor
   pibo debug message-queue
   pibo debug message-queue inspect --session <ps_...>
   ```

   Record the exact blocking `cmd_...`, event identity, lease freshness, terminal evidence, and listed successors. Inspection always shows active/uncertain work plus bounded recent terminal context; follow its `--after-stream` or `--before-terminal-stream` next command when output is truncated. Output contains identities and states, never message bodies.

2. If the command has a fresh owner lease, stop. Do not reconcile live ownership. Reinspect after the owner finishes or its lease expires.

3. Choose a conservative outcome. Never choose based only on a lack of recent UI output:

   - If durable `message_finished` or `message_steered` evidence matches, preview completion with `pibo debug message-queue reconcile <cmd_...> --confirm-completed --dry-run`.
   - If side effects are uncertain, preview failure without replay using `pibo debug message-queue reconcile <cmd_...> --mark-failed --dry-run`.
   - Use `--cancel-successors` to cancel all listed unstarted successors, or repeated `--cancel-successor <cmd_...>` for exact selected successors. Dry-run and apply both refuse the entire operation if a selected successor has a fresh owner lease. Without cancellation, genuinely unstarted successors become dispatchable after the barrier settles.
   - Completion without durable evidence requires the exact high-friction acknowledgement `--confirm-without-evidence <same-cmd-id>`. Obtain operator confirmation that provider/tool side effects already completed before using it.
   - Replay is unsupported. Do not resubmit the old payload as a recovery shortcut.

4. Review the dry-run's exact command transition, evidence references, and successor set. Apply the same decision:

   ```text
   pibo debug message-queue reconcile <cmd_...> --mark-failed --cancel-successors --apply
   ```

   Apply rereads/fences the snapshot in one transaction, refuses changed/live work, and appends a body-free audit event. If it reports a race, inspect again rather than forcing it.

5. Verify the resulting queue and Session:

   ```text
   pibo debug message-queue inspect --session <ps_...>
   pibo gateway web doctor
   pibo debug session <ps_...>
   pibo debug trace <ps_...> --check
   ```

   A resolved barrier is terminal, selected successors are explicitly failed, and no command is replayed by reconciliation. Historical receipt recovery does not rewrite Session/navigation status, so verify that newer completed or live work remains authoritative. `doctor` should return healthy unless another durable inconsistency or capacity limit remains.

`/clear` and durable reconciliation are different operations. `/clear` cancels unstarted commands and runtime queue work; it cannot decide the outcome of an interrupted predecessor. Preserve the command, payload reference, terminal evidence, and reconciliation audit event for incident review.

## Service restart validation

After installing a candidate and restarting the development gateway:

1. verify the active executable and commit;
2. verify local and public Chat Web readiness;
3. reopen one durable Pi session and one durable Codex thread;
4. confirm unchanged Pibo/native ids and `bound` state;
5. complete one turn through each runtime;
6. run `pibo debug trace <ps_...> --check`;
7. inspect browser console/network and the relevant UI flow;
8. verify no leaked App Server or generation process remains after disposal.

## Failure triage

### Long-running delegated agent

A delegated send has no default or profile-driven wall-clock deadline and may run for hours. `pibo_run_wait` defaults to 30 seconds and is capped at 300 seconds per call; a wait timeout reports that the run is still active and does not cancel it. It is normal for a delegated run to have no `timeoutMs` or `timeoutAt`. A stale telemetry or signal hint is read-only diagnosis, not an automatic timeout or recovery action.

Inspect the run with `pibo_run_status`, the child with `pibo_agents_observe`, and the terminal result with `pibo_run_read`. Stop work only deliberately through `pibo_run_cancel` or `pibo_agents_kill`, unless parent abort or session/router disposal already owns cleanup.

### Provider or protocol error

Inspect `pibo debug failures`, then send a bounded recovery turn only after status is idle. A provider error may be retryable or terminal for that turn without invalidating the binding.

### Stuck interruption

Confirm status and process state. The Codex adapter interrupts the active turn and then recycles the App Server so the provider connection cannot remain live. The next turn should resume the same thread.

### Missing Codex thread

Expect a safe conflict and a persisted `missing` binding. Absolute rollout paths, auth paths, or raw native errors must not reach the product response.

### Resource delivery failure

Use Context Build. A required failed or unsupported contribution blocks startup. Do not treat a generated file as proof that an MCP server, skill root, or context contribution loaded.

### TUI validation

Use the deterministic PTY scenario for a credential-free terminal smoke test:

```text
pibo debug pty scenario --builtin cli-session-ui-mocked-e2e --artifact
```

The scenario follows the current room picker, creates a session, sends a mocked turn, inspects `/status`, and exits without invoking a provider.

## Security rules

- Do not print or copy auth files, cookies, machine keys, bearer tokens, environment secrets, device codes, account identifiers, or private locator/config values.
- Do not move Pi credentials, local Codex credentials, or one Codex instance's credentials into another runtime home.
- Do not mutate global Codex or Pi configuration merely to run one Pibo Session.
- Do not broaden generated Pibo MCP credentials beyond the selected generation and tool allowlist.
- Do not pre-approve external MCP servers globally.
- Do not infer a capability from an upstream schema alone; require end-to-end evidence.
