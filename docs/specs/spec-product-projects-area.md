# Introduction

This specification captures the proposed **Projects** area for the Pibo Chat Web App.

Projects are a coding-project-focused sibling module to the existing `Sessions` area. The current `Sessions` area remains unchanged. The new `Projects` area must start as a separate session-like module: it uses the same room/session interaction model, terminal/transcript surface, composer, sub-session tree, traces, and CRUD behavior, but it stores and routes its data separately from `Sessions`. Workflow state is the extra concept that Projects adds on top of the normal chat/session experience.

A Project Session is still a chat session. The simplest workflow is a one-node workflow, currently described as `simple-chat`, that does nothing beyond exposing the normal Session surface. When every Project Session uses this workflow, the Projects tab behaves like a 1:1 copy of the Sessions tab with separate routes and separate data. More complex workflows, such as `standard-project`, can then add states, graph edges, decisions, review steps, and cleanup behavior without replacing the selected-session chat surface.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

The purpose of the Projects area is to make agent-driven project work easier to manage. V1 focuses on standard coding sessions that move from feature/change idea to spec, plan, implementation, agent testing, human review, and cleanup.

In scope for the initial Projects concept:

- A new top-level `Projects` tab in the Chat Web App header/top bar.
- A Projects experience that is a 1:1 copy of the existing Sessions tab layout, behavior, sidebar hierarchy, session tree, selected-session pane, composer, terminal/session views, and CRUD controls, with Workflow and Project metadata added.
- Project containers that replace the user-facing label `Rooms` with `Projects` in the Projects module.
- The Projects sidebar shows its own green Personal Chat entry at the top, styled like the Sessions sidebar Personal Chat entry, but backed by separate Projects data and the `~/.pibo/projects/workspace` working directory.
- Separate Projects routes, selection state, and storage partitioning so Rooms/Sessions and Projects/Project Sessions do not mix.
- Every Project must be linked to a concrete local project folder/workspace path at creation time. Draft/unconfigured Projects are not part of V1.
- Each Project can contain many Project Sessions.
- Project Sessions are normal Pibo runtime/chat sessions with additional Project and Workflow metadata.
- Project Sessions have explicit workflow definitions. In V1, `simple-chat` is the only implemented workflow, but it must still use the workflow definition interface so later workflows can be added cleanly.
- V1 must support the one-node workflow so Projects can ship as a separate Sessions clone before complex workflow behavior is complete.
- `standard-project` is the first complex coding workflow target after V1. It can add specs, planning, implementation, agent testing, human review, and cleanup states.
- Sub-Sessions are created by subagent calls from a Main Project Session and remain visible/selectable in the Project Session tree.
- Main Project Sessions have an extensible workflow state machine when their workflow is more complex than `simple-chat`.
- Complex workflow state machines must be selected by workflow id so future workflows can define their own states and logic.
- Human review actions such as approve, send back with reason, or discard.
- Cleanup-oriented actions that help decide what to keep, push, merge, or discard after agent work.

Out of scope for V1:

- Removing or changing the existing `Sessions` area.
- Reusing the exact same Room and Session records in both the Sessions and Projects tabs without an explicit module discriminator.
- Implementing non-standard complex Project workflows such as Research Sessions.
- Full Git hosting integration design.
- Full CI/CD pipeline orchestration.
- Multi-user/team permissions beyond the existing owner-scope model.
- Complete knowledge/document management design, except as a future extension direction.

## 2. Definitions

- **Sessions Area**: The existing top-level Chat Web App area for general chat rooms and sessions.
- **Projects Area**: The top-level Chat Web App area reached through the `Projects` tab. It is a separate session-like module, not a filtered view of Sessions.
- **Pibo Project**: A user-facing work container that groups Project Sessions and is always linked to one local project folder in V1.
- **Project Folder**: The local workspace/root path associated with a Pibo Project. It is the source project folder from which isolated session worktrees are created.
- **Project Session**: A normal Pibo runtime/chat session associated with a Pibo Project. It keeps the standard Session transcript, terminal/session view, composer, status, trace view, tree behavior, archive/delete behavior, and Sub-Session hierarchy, and adds Project/Workflow metadata.
- **Workflow Definition**: The process graph selected for a Project Session. It defines nodes, edges, allowed transitions, waiting states, and actions.
- **`simple-chat` Workflow**: The one-node workflow. It represents the normal chat/session behavior with no extra process gates. If all Project Sessions use `simple-chat`, Projects behaves like an isolated clone of Sessions.
- **`standard-project` Workflow**: The first complex coding workflow target. It represents one feature, change, bugfix, or similar coding work item and follows the specs/plan/implementation/test/review/cleanup flow.
- **Project Session Type**: A product label for the workflow family of a Project Session, such as `simple-chat`, `standard-project`, or a future `research` type.
- **Research Session**: A future Project Session type focused on gathering information, analysis, comparison, investigation, and recommendations. It may have its own states and logic and is not implemented in V1.
- **Main Project Session**: A top-level Project Session inside a Project. For complex workflows, it owns the workflow run state.
- **Sub-Session**: A child Pibo Session created when the agent in a Main Project Session calls a subagent. A Sub-Session follows the delegated task, appears in the Project Session tree, and remains selectable as a normal session surface.
- **Project Session Workspace**: The isolated worktree and Docker compute worker assigned to one Project Session when the chosen workflow needs execution isolation. `simple-chat` does not create a worktree or Docker worker in V1.
- **Projects Personal Chat**: The Projects module's own Personal Chat entry. It is separate from the Sessions module Personal Chat and uses `~/.pibo/projects/workspace` as its default working directory.
- **Workflow State**: The current node/phase of a Project Session's workflow run.
- **Session State Class**: A code-level state implementation that owns the behavior, available actions, validation, prompts, and side effects for one state.
- **Project State Machine**: The orchestration layer that owns allowed transitions between Workflow States for Main Project Sessions but does not embed state-specific behavior.
- **Spec Phase**: The standard-project phase where the desired feature/change is converted into durable specs.
- **Plan Phase**: The standard-project phase where an executable implementation plan is derived from the accepted specs.
- **Implementation Phase**: The standard-project phase where agents perform the coding work in the isolated Docker worker/worktree of the Main Session and may create Sub-Sessions for delegated work.
- **Agent Test Phase**: The standard-project automated/self-test phase run by the agent before work is handed to the user.
- **Human Review Phase**: The standard-project phase where the agent has already tested its own work and the human user reviews, tests, accepts, rejects, or asks for changes.
- **Cleanup Phase**: The standard-project phase where Pibo helps the user decide what to keep, discard, push, merge, or otherwise finalize.

## 3. Product Model

### 3.1 Projects vs Sessions

The existing `Sessions` area remains the general conversation/session surface.

The new `Projects` area is optimized for coding and project work, but its first product shape is deliberately the same as Sessions:

- The top-level tab is `Projects`, not `Sessions`.
- The left-side grouping concept is called `Projects`, not `Rooms`.
- The session list is called `Project Sessions`, not `Sessions`, where the distinction matters.
- The selected Project Session opens the same kind of main surface as a selected Session: terminal/transcript, trace controls, model/profile/status header, slash commands, and composer.
- A Project must have a project folder at creation time in V1.
- A Project can contain multiple Project Sessions over time.
- Each Main Project Session represents one topic or work order, such as a feature, bugfix, research report, documentation update, investigation, or cleanup task.
- Each Main Project Session has a selected workflow.
- V1 implements only `simple-chat` as the one-node baseline workflow, but the workflow registry/interface must exist from the start.
- `standard-project` is the first complex workflow target after V1 for feature/change/bugfix work.
- Future Main Session workflows may have different graphs. For example, a Research workflow may focus on information gathering and analysis instead of code implementation.
- Sub-Sessions appear below the Main Project Session when subagents are called.
- A Project may later collect knowledge, documentation, project files, acceptance notes, and operational history.

### 3.2 Relationship to Pibo Rooms and Routes

Projects should use their own Projects storage from the start. The product concept, route space, and persistence must remain separate from Rooms/Sessions. V1 lists all Projects in that storage, regardless of owner scope; owner-scoped filtering can be added later.

- A Pibo Room is a general Chat Web container in the Sessions module.
- A Pibo Project is a coding-focused product container in the Projects module.
- V1 should create a separate Projects database, for example `.pibo/web-projects.sqlite`, with first-class Projects tables rather than mixing Project containers into Room tables.
- Rooms from the Sessions tab must not appear as Projects.
- Projects from the Projects tab must not appear as Rooms.
- Session records created in the Sessions tab must not appear as Project Sessions.
- Project Sessions created in the Projects tab must not appear in the Sessions tab unless a future feature explicitly exports or links them.
- Projects routes must be their own route family, for example `/projects`, `/projects/:projectId`, and `/projects/:projectId/sessions/:piboSessionId`.
- Project actions must not redirect to `/rooms/:roomId` or `/sessions/:piboSessionId`.
- If any temporary bridge to existing room/session code is needed, it must remain an implementation detail and must not leak product language or routes.
- UI labels in the Projects area must consistently say `Project`/`Projects`, not `Room`/`Rooms`.

### 3.3 Project Folder Requirement

Every Project must be linked to one local project folder at creation time.

The folder link should provide:

- Display name/path in the Project header.
- Source workspace context for new Project Sessions.
- A stable basis for later workflow-specific workspace setup and cleanup checks such as Git status, worktree state, branch, changed files, and test commands.

V1 Project folder rules:

- The user may point a Project at any existing local folder; it does not have to be under a Pibo-managed directory.
- The existing folder may contain arbitrary files and does not need to be empty.
- V1 does not need to verify that the folder is a Git repository.
- Project creation requires `name` and `projectFolder`; `description` is optional.
- Project names must be unique.
- Project folders must be unique; two Projects must not point to the same folder.
- When creating a new folder, the user selects or enters a parent path and a Project name; Pibo creates the folder on disk and sets the Project folder to that new path.
- V1 may use direct path entry for folder selection. A richer file explorer can be added later.

### 3.4 Project Session Workflows

Project Sessions must select a workflow to keep the system extensible.

V1 must support the `simple-chat` workflow as the only implemented workflow:

- It is the default and only selectable workflow while Projects is first introduced.
- It has one effective node and no extra process gates.
- It preserves normal chat/session behavior.
- It lets Projects ship as a separate clone of Sessions while the Workflow foundation is hardened.

The first complex workflow target after V1 is `standard-project`:

- It represents coding work such as a feature, change, bugfix, refactor, cleanup, or similar implementation task.
- It uses the standard specs/plan/implementation/agent-test/human-review/cleanup flow.
- It may be optional or experimental until the Workflow runner, state persistence, worker isolation, and UI actions are ready.

Future workflows should be possible without changing the core Project model:

- A `research` workflow could gather information, inspect code, compare options, analyze logs, summarize tradeoffs, or produce recommendations.
- A research workflow might use states such as `question`, `research`, `analysis`, `summary`, and `completed`.
- Other future workflows may support documentation, design, incident analysis, release preparation, migration planning, or dependency upgrade workflows.

Each workflow should be able to define:

- Its own node/state names.
- Its own state classes and behavior.
- Its own allowed transitions.
- Its own default prompts and acceptance criteria.
- Its own UI actions.
- Its own completion and failure semantics.

### 3.5 Project Session Isolation

Project Sessions should create and use isolated execution workspaces only when the selected workflow requires execution isolation. `simple-chat` Project Sessions do not create Docker compute workers or worktrees in V1.

For workflows that require execution isolation:

- A new worktree is created for the session.
- A Docker compute worker is spawned for the session.
- The agent for that session works only inside that session's worktree and Docker worker.
- Browser checks, builds, tests, gateway restarts, and implementation commands run inside the worker context.
- The host checkout must not be used as the experimental workspace.
- The Project Session should persist the worker id, worktree path, branch name, web port, CDP port, and lifecycle status when available.

This keeps each standard feature attempt, future research/investigation task, and delegated subagent task reviewable, disposable, and safe to clean up.

### 3.6 Main Sessions and Sub-Sessions

Projects must clearly distinguish Main Sessions from Sub-Sessions:

- Main Sessions are top-level Project Sessions inside a Project.
- Main Sessions select or own the workflow run.
- For `simple-chat`, the workflow run adds no extra visible process beyond normal chat.
- For complex workflows, Main Sessions own the workflow state and follow the workflow graph.
- Sub-Sessions are created by the Main Session's agent when it invokes subagents.
- Sub-Sessions are children of the Main Session through normal Pibo Session hierarchy.
- Sub-Sessions are not independently driven through the Main Session's project workflow states unless a future workflow explicitly models that behavior.
- A Sub-Session's scope is the task delegated by the Main Session's agent.
- The Main Session remains responsible for integrating subagent results into its workflow state.

### 3.7 Projects Tab Parity Rule

The Projects tab must start as a visual and behavioral clone of the Sessions tab, not as a settings-style page and not as a workflow-only dashboard.

Required layout:

```text
Top nav: Sessions | Projects | Agents | Context | Settings

Projects sidebar:
  Personal Chat        // Projects-owned green personal chat row, styled like Sessions
  Projects             // same position where Sessions shows Rooms
    Project A
    Project B
    Archived Projects
  Project Sessions     // same position where Sessions shows Sessions
    Main Project Session
      Sub-Session
```

The Projects tab may add workflow status chips, workflow run panels, workflow selection menus, review actions, and project-folder metadata. These controls are additive. They must not replace the copied Sessions structure, session tree, selected Session view, terminal/transcript, trace controls, or chat composer.

The green Personal Chat row in Projects is a Projects-owned Personal Chat, not a link to the Sessions module Personal Chat. It uses `~/.pibo/projects/workspace` as its working directory and uses `simple-chat` by default.

Parity means the Projects area keeps the same user capabilities as Sessions unless this spec explicitly says otherwise:

- Project rows have the same row density, hover state, active state, inline edit behavior, archive/restore affordance, delete flow, empty states, and mobile behavior as Room rows.
- Project Sessions have the same creation, selection, rename, archive/restore, delete, active/archived grouping, Sub-Session tree, unread/status badges, and mobile behavior as Sessions.
- Selecting a Project Session opens the same main Session surface used by Sessions: terminal/transcript view, session-view selector, trace/raw-events controls, model/profile/status header, slash commands, and composer.
- Workflow UI sits around or above the selected Session surface.

### 3.8 Project Session Interaction Model

A Project Session is still a Pibo Session. The Project association adds workflow state, project folder context, workspace metadata, and Project-scoped navigation; it does not remove chat behavior.

Required selected-session surface:

```text
Project header / workflow controls / workflow status
Selected Project Session header
Session terminal or transcript view
Runtime trace and raw-events controls
Chat composer with the same commands and behavior as Sessions
```

The user must be able to talk to the selected Project Session, watch its runtime output, inspect traces, and switch to Sub-Sessions in the same way they can in the Sessions tab.

Project Session creation should mirror normal Session creation, with the Projects-specific addition that a workflow is selected at creation time. In V1, the only available workflow is `simple-chat`, so the UI may preselect it while still persisting it through the workflow model.

## 4. Standard Project Workflow

### 4.1 Required Flow

The first complex workflow target is `standard-project`. A standard Main Project Session should normally start in the specs/planning part of the workflow and then move through the complete feature/change/bugfix lifecycle:

```text
specs -> plan -> implementation -> agent_test
                            ^              |
                            |              v
                    needs_changes <- agent_test_failed
                                           |
                                           v
                                     human_review
                                           |
            +------------------------------+------------------------------+
            v                              v                              v
        cleanup                    implementation                    discarded
            |
            v
        completed
```

The important product rules are:

- A standard Main Session usually represents one feature, change, bugfix, refactor, cleanup, or similar coding work item.
- The Main Session is the unit that moves through workflow states.
- The desired change should first become a spec update.
- The implementation plan is derived from the specs.
- Execution follows the plan.
- The agent tests its own work before handing it to the user.
- The user reviews only after the agent believes the work is ready.
- Sub-Sessions can be created during implementation or other phases, but they do not own the Main Session state.

### 4.2 States

Required `standard-project` Main Session states:

- `specs`: The desired feature/change/bugfix is converted into durable specs. Standard Main Sessions normally start here.
- `plan`: The agent derives an execution plan from the specs.
- `implementation`: The agent executes the plan in the session worktree/Docker worker and may delegate work to Sub-Sessions.
- `agent_test`: The agent runs its own tests and checks.
- `needs_changes`: The work needs another implementation iteration after failed tests or explicit feedback.
- `human_review`: The work is ready for the user to test and accept or reject.
- `cleanup`: The user approved the direction and Pibo helps finalize the working tree.
- `completed`: The Main Session's feature/change/bugfix is finalized.
- `failed`: The agent reached the retry limit or determines it cannot complete the work.
- `discarded`: The Main Session's feature/change/bugfix is intentionally abandoned.

Optional future or UI-only pre-state:

- `discussion`: The user and agent clarify a desired change before a formal Project Session is started. If represented as a state, it must transition into `specs` before implementation can begin.

### 4.3 Retry Loop

The implementation/test loop must support bounded retries on the standard Main Session:

```text
implementation -> agent_test -> needs_changes -> implementation
```

- The Main Session should track `retryCount` and `maxRetries`.
- `agent_test` may transition to `human_review` when checks pass.
- `agent_test` may transition to `needs_changes` when checks fail and retries remain.
- `agent_test` may transition to `failed` when retries are exhausted.
- The agent may also mark the Main Session as `failed` when it determines the requested work cannot be completed safely or correctly.
- Each failed test iteration should produce a durable reason and summary.

### 4.4 Human Review Actions

In the `human_review` state, the user must have clear decision actions:

- **Approve / Release**: Move the Main Session to `cleanup`.
- **Send back**: Move the Main Session back to `needs_changes` or `implementation` with a required reason.
- **Discard**: Move the Main Session to `discarded`, preferably with an optional reason.

The send-back reason must become durable context so the next agent iteration can see what was rejected or missing.

### 4.5 Cleanup Actions

In the `cleanup` state, Pibo should help answer:

- What changed in the Main Session worktree and relevant Sub-Session worktrees?
- Which files should be kept?
- Which files should be reverted or deleted?
- Are tests still passing?
- Should this be committed, pushed, merged to `main`, or left as a branch/worktree?
- Should session Docker workers be released?

Initial UI actions may be lightweight wrappers around inspectable operations:

- Show Git status.
- Show changed files.
- Show diffs.
- Run configured test command.
- Mark files/changes as keep or discard.
- Create a cleanup summary.
- Release Docker compute workers after confirmation.
- Mark cleanup as completed.

Potential later actions:

- Create commit.
- Push branch.
- Open pull request.
- Merge to main.
- Delete or archive worktrees.

## 5. State Machine Architecture

The state system should be extensible across workflows. The state machine defines flow; state classes define behavior.

### 5.1 Design Principle

- The **Project State Machine** owns allowed transitions and transition history for Main Sessions that run complex workflows.
- Workflow/state-machine definitions are scoped by workflow id.
- `simple-chat` must be valid as the one-node/no-extra-gates workflow.
- Each **Session State Class** owns the functionality of one complex workflow state.
- Adding a new workflow should not require rewriting the standard-project workflow.
- Adding a new state to one workflow should not require rewriting one large state-machine function.
- UI actions should be derived from the active state class where possible.
- State-specific prompts, validation, side effects, and completion criteria should live with the state class.
- Sub-Sessions do not execute the Main Session state machine directly. They receive their behavior from the delegated subagent task and report results back through the normal session/subagent trace.

### 5.2 Draft Interfaces

```ts
export type PiboProjectWorkflowId = "simple-chat" | "standard-project" | string;

export type PiboStandardProjectSessionStateName =
  | "specs"
  | "plan"
  | "implementation"
  | "agent_test"
  | "needs_changes"
  | "human_review"
  | "cleanup"
  | "completed"
  | "failed"
  | "discarded";

export type PiboProjectSessionKind = "main" | "sub";

export type PiboProjectTransition = {
  piboSessionId: string;
  workflowId: PiboProjectWorkflowId;
  from: string;
  to: string;
  action: string;
  reason?: string;
};

export type PiboProjectAction = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  kind: "user" | "agent" | "system";
  requiresReason?: boolean;
  destructive?: boolean;
};

export interface PiboProjectSessionStateHandler {
  readonly workflowId: PiboProjectWorkflowId;
  readonly name: string;

  getAvailableActions(context: PiboProjectSessionStateContext): PiboProjectAction[];

  canEnter?(context: PiboProjectSessionStateContext): Promise<boolean> | boolean;
  onEnter?(context: PiboProjectSessionStateContext): Promise<void> | void;
  onExit?(context: PiboProjectSessionStateContext): Promise<void> | void;

  handleAction(
    actionId: string,
    context: PiboProjectSessionStateContext,
    input?: Record<string, unknown>,
  ): Promise<PiboProjectTransition | void> | PiboProjectTransition | void;
}

export interface PiboProjectStateMachineDefinition {
  readonly workflowId: PiboProjectWorkflowId;
  readonly initialState: string;
  canTransition(from: string, to: string): boolean;
  transition(transition: PiboProjectTransition): Promise<void>;
}

export interface PiboProjectWorkflowDefinition {
  readonly id: PiboProjectWorkflowId;
  readonly label: string;
  readonly stateMachine: PiboProjectStateMachineDefinition;
  getStateHandler(stateName: string): PiboProjectSessionStateHandler | undefined;
}
```

The exact interface can change during implementation, but the separation should remain: workflow definitions select the state machine and handlers; state handlers own behavior; the state machine owns flow and transition persistence for Main Sessions.

Project Sessions may initially be associated through `PiboSession.metadata.projectId`, `PiboSession.metadata.projectSessionKind`, `PiboSession.metadata.projectWorkflowId`, `PiboSession.metadata.projectWorkflowRunId`, and normal `parentId` hierarchy. Project container and workflow metadata should live in the Projects-owned database, separate from Room storage. Long-term implementations may introduce additional first-class relation tables if needed.

## 8. Future Extensions

Projects are intended to become more than session groups. Future versions may add:

- Research Sessions for information gathering, codebase analysis, tradeoff analysis, and recommendations.
- Project knowledge and documentation.
- Project-scoped context files.
- Acceptance criteria tracking.
- Agent-generated implementation plans.
- Test plans and manual test checklists.
- Git branch/worktree lifecycle management.
- Docker worker lifecycle tracking.
- Project-level summaries across many sessions.
- Reusable cleanup playbooks.
- GitHub/GitLab pull request integration.
- CI result integration.

## 9. Open Questions

- Should a standard Main Session always start in `specs`, or can some sessions import existing specs and start in `plan`?
- What should the first post-V1 Project workflow be after `standard-project`: `research`, documentation, incident analysis, or something else?
- Should Sub-Sessions inherit the Main Session workflow, use their own workflow, or remain untyped delegated work?
- Should Sub-Sessions always receive separate worktrees/workers for execution workflows, or should some delegated tasks share the Main Session workspace?
- Can project folders later represent remote repositories, or are Projects always local-folder-backed?
- Which cleanup operations should be UI-only confirmations vs direct executable actions?
- How much Git automation is safe before explicit user confirmation is required?
- What should the default `maxRetries` be for the agent implementation/test loop?
