# Debug CLI, Web Diagnostics, and PTY Validation

## Why

Debugging needs bounded evidence capture across stores, Web targets, and PTYs without replacing the systems being diagnosed.

## Scope

This specification describes implemented behavior at the traceability commit. It owns the contracts listed below and does not turn adjacent implementation or future plans into current authority.

### In scope

- Debug CLI projections, bounded formatting/drill-down, Web snapshot/diff/watch/scenario/report evidence, PTY scenario validation/execution/assertions/artifacts, and explicit diagnostic mutation/provider gates.

### Out of scope

- Product data, trace, event, run, telemetry, or signal truth; debug reads owner APIs/stores.
- Browser templates/leases/CDP process ownership owned by SPC-CMP-003; debug consumes an existing target.
- Chat Web renderer behavior and stable anchors owned by SPC-WEB-005.
- Gateway/session lifecycle or provider behavior.

## Current behavior

### Commands

- pibo debug db|session|trace|summary|messages|final|tool|failures|events|agents|jobs|runs|resources|signals|telemetry|persistence|repair|web|pty; Web branches targets|attach-chat|snapshot|diff|watch|scenario|report; PTY branches run|scenario|list-scenarios.

### Apis

- Debug consumes authenticated GET /api/chat/debug/persistence and resource diagnostics plus POST /api/chat/debug/trace-at-sequence and /api/chat/debug/streaming-fixture; route ownership remains Chat Web. Signals consume live gateway APIs.

### State

- Local debug defaults read owner stores read-only; persistence audit reports incomplete lifecycles, identity collisions, queue/dead-letter state, and bounded detail. Run-job listing reports claim expiry, missing run rows, and effective liveness without payloads; orphan cleanup requires explicit dry-run or apply. Repair is dry-run by default and applies only with exact completed Product History, Reliability, or adapter evidence. Optional explicit artifact directories hold Web/PTY evidence.

### Lifecycle

- Resolve store/session/target; inspect or capture bounded evidence; redact/format; emit next commands; always terminate PTY/observer/CDP work and write failure artifacts when configured.

### Failure

- Unknown store/session/target, malformed scenario, assertion failure, missing expected events, nonzero child exits, one wall-clock deadline, ignored abort/cancel, and cleanup failure remain explicit. Repair refuses active, ambiguous, duplicate, conflicting, already-complete, or evidence-free targets. Real-provider runs require opt-in, positive iteration bound, timeouts, and stop condition.

### Security

- Read-only query parser rejects mutation and multiple statements; output/artifacts redact secrets and native metadata; cookie/auth inputs are explicit; prune/apply and real-provider flags are deliberate.

### Compatibility

- Debug projections are disposable views, never source authority. Deterministic mocked PTY and streaming fixtures are the default; headful/real-provider evidence is a separate acceptance class.

## Requirements and invariants

### Requirement: OP-DEBUG-001

Expose bounded progressive discovery for all debug branches and drill from summaries to details with stable next-command hints.

#### Current

The upstream/dev refresh implementation and named tests provide the current source-grounded contract. The named tests were inspected and later executed only as recorded in the implementation report; they do not expand this requirement beyond the cited behavior.

#### Acceptance

- Source: `src/debug/index.ts` — `runDebugCli`; `src/debug/index.ts` — `printDebugDiscovery`; `src/debug/detail-format.ts` — `sliceTextByBytes`; `src/debug/next-commands.ts` — `formatNextCommands`
- Tests: `test/debug-cli.test.mjs` — “pibo debug help stays progressive”; `test/debug-cli.test.mjs` — “pibo debug tool, failures, summary, and trace show expose next drill-down commands”
- Failure/security boundary: Unknown branches and detail requests fail explicitly; output and next-command hints are byte/row bounded.
- Confidence: **high**

### Requirement: OP-DEBUG-002

Read and reconstruct owner data for sessions, messages, events, traces, failures, telemetry, resources, runs, and signals without becoming source authority.

#### Current

The upstream/dev refresh implementation and named tests provide the current source-grounded contract. The named tests were inspected and later executed only as recorded in the implementation report; they do not expand this requirement beyond the cited behavior.

#### Acceptance

- Source: `src/debug/sql.ts` — `runReadOnlyQuery`; `src/debug/session.ts` — `inspectDebugSession`; `src/debug/events.ts` — `inspectDebugEvents`; `src/debug/telemetry.ts` — `inspectTelemetrySessions`
- Tests: `test/debug-cli.test.mjs` — “pibo debug db discovers schema and runs limited read-only SQL”; `test/debug-cli.test.mjs` — “pibo debug db rejects mutating and multi-statement SQL”; `test/debug-cli.test.mjs` — “pibo debug trace prints rebuilt Chat Web trace nodes”; `test/debug-trace-checks.test.mjs` — “debug trace check reports duplicate stable keys”
- Failure/security boundary: Debug reads owner stores/APIs without mutating them; SQL rejects mutation and multiple statements.
- Confidence: **high**

### Requirement: OP-DEBUG-003

Capture Web targets, snapshots, diffs, bounded watches, scenarios, streaming benchmarks, and reports while deterministically cleaning observer and EventSource state.

#### Current

The upstream/dev refresh implementation and named tests provide the current source-grounded contract. The named tests were inspected and later executed only as recorded in the implementation report; they do not expand this requirement beyond the cited behavior.

#### Acceptance

- Source: `src/debug/web.ts` — `runDebugWeb`; `src/debug/web-options.ts` — `DEFAULT_WATCH_DURATION_MS`; `src/debug/web-render-analysis.ts` — `diffSnapshots`; `src/debug/web-streaming-browser-library.ts` — `browserStreamingBenchmarkLibrary`
- Tests: `test/debug-cli.test.mjs` — “pibo debug web report renders saved streaming benchmark artifacts without CDP”; `test/debug-cli.test.mjs` — “pibo debug web streaming benchmark help advertises the deterministic fixture”; `test/debug-web-streaming-cleanup.test.mjs` — “SSE stop returns a detached result when read and cancel ignore abort”; `test/debug-web-streaming-cleanup.test.mjs` — “render-order capture clears every session buffer observed during navigation”
- Failure/security boundary: Observers, EventSources, CDP work, and artifacts require deterministic cleanup; headless fixtures are not visual acceptance.
- Confidence: **high**

### Requirement: OP-DEBUG-004

Run host or named-worker PTYs from validated scenarios with bounded terminal geometry/timeouts/input, assertions, deterministic cleanup, and raw/clean evidence artifacts.

#### Current

The upstream/dev refresh implementation and named tests provide the current source-grounded contract. The named tests were inspected and later executed only as recorded in the implementation report; they do not expand this requirement beyond the cited behavior.

#### Acceptance

- Source: `src/debug/pty.ts` — `runDebugPty`; `src/debug/pty.ts` — `validateScenario`; `src/debug/pty.ts` — `executePtyScenario`
- Tests: `test/debug-pty.test.mjs` — “pibo debug pty run captures host PTY output and artifacts”; `test/debug-pty.test.mjs` — “pibo debug pty scenario types input through an interactive PTY”; `test/debug-pty.test.mjs` — “built-in mocked CLI session scenario follows the room and session picker flow”
- Failure/security boundary: Malformed scenarios, assertions, timeouts, ignored cancellation, and cleanup failures remain visible in bounded artifacts.
- Confidence: **high**

### Requirement: OP-DEBUG-006: Run-job diagnostics expose orphan liveness and gate cleanup

`pibo debug jobs list --queue runs` SHALL expose claim expiry, matching-run presence, and effective liveness without payloads. `pibo debug jobs reconcile-runs` SHALL require exactly one of `--dry-run` or `--apply`, list only expired orphan candidates, and SHALL NOT replay side effects. Apply moves candidates to the dead-letter queue through the reliability owner.

### Requirement: OP-DEBUG-005

Default diagnostics to bounded/read-only/mock behavior and require explicit apply, destructive, real-provider, and iteration controls for state-changing or external paths.

#### Current

The upstream/dev refresh implementation and named tests provide the current source-grounded contract. The named tests were inspected and later executed only as recorded in the implementation report; they do not expand this requirement beyond the cited behavior.

#### Acceptance

- Source: `src/debug/index.ts` — `runDebugTelemetry`; `src/debug/delta-compaction.ts` — `runDeltaCompaction`; `src/debug/pty.ts` — `validateProviderSafety`
- Tests: `test/debug-cli.test.mjs` — “pibo debug telemetry inspects tool calls, stale work, stats, and dry-run-first prune”; `test/debug-pty.test.mjs` — “pibo debug pty real-provider mode requires explicit safety opt-in”
- Failure/security boundary: Apply, prune, destructive, real-provider, and iteration modes require deliberate safety gates and bounds.
- Confidence: **high**

## Interfaces and ownership

**Capability IDs:** pibo.operator.debug

**Public surfaces:**

- [/specs/operator/terminal-ui.md](/specs/operator/terminal-ui.md)

## Failure and security behavior

- Unknown store/session/target, malformed scenario, assertion failure, timeout, ignored abort/cancel, and cleanup failure remain explicit. Real-provider runs require opt-in, positive iteration bound, timeouts, and stop condition.
- Read-only query parser rejects mutation and multiple statements; output/artifacts redact secrets and native metadata; cookie/auth inputs are explicit; prune/apply and real-provider flags are deliberate.

## Known limits

- The synthesis source list src/debug omits Chat Web route-owner symbols for the cited debug APIs; the spec must mark those APIs as consumed surfaces and depend on their owners.
- No real PTY, authenticated gateway signal path, or headed browser validation was performed.
- The PTY scenario TypeScript shape is internal; the CLI JSON validation behavior, not an exported type, is the compatibility contract.

## Reconciled stale claims

- Reject debug projections as product truth or persistence owners.
- Reject real-provider PTY as the default; deterministic mocked mode is default.
- Reject fixture/headless evidence as sufficient visual acceptance.
- Reject debug ownership of browser leases, product renderer behavior, signal semantics, or gateway lifecycle.
- Reject pibo debug signals as a local store snapshot; it reads a live authenticated API.

## Verification and traceability

All source and named-test references are bound to commit `aacf12b17e8ba92249a901b3e1d44d57a35f9bf8`. The traceability commit is evidence authority; it does not imply that a test, build, package, Docker, deployment-pool, browser/CDP, headful, PTY, gateway-restart, real-host/provider, Windows, or Pibo2 path passed. Focused execution and build/typecheck/package results are recorded in the implementation report.

Later validation commands:

- node --test test/debug-cli.test.mjs test/debug-trace-checks.test.mjs test/debug-pty.test.mjs test/debug-web-streaming-cleanup.test.mjs
- npm run build
- pibo debug --help && pibo debug web --help && pibo debug pty --help
- pibo debug pty scenario --builtin cli-session-ui-mocked-e2e --artifact
