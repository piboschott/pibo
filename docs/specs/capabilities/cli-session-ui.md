# Spec: CLI Session UI

**Status:** Draft  
**Created:** 2026-05-16  
**Owner / Source:** User request and `docs/reports/ink-cli-session-subset-report.md`  
**Related docs:** `docs/specs/capabilities/chat-web-trace-and-terminal-view.md`, `docs/specs/capabilities/local-routed-tui.md`, `docs/specs/capabilities/shared-terminal-view-model.md`, `docs/specs/changes/ink-cli-session-ui/`

## Why

Pibo needs a native shell-first interface for operators and agents who connect over SSH, work on a fresh server, recover from a broken Web UI/Web Gateway, or want to interact with a Pibo session without opening a browser.

The existing Chat Web UI remains the primary Pibo control center. The CLI Session UI is a reduced session-oriented interface derived from the Web Chat session experience. It must provide the minimum viable Pibo chat/session workflow while excluding project, workflow, automation, and designer surfaces that belong in the Web UI.

## Goal

Provide an Ink-based native terminal UI for starting, selecting, and operating Pibo chat sessions while reusing shared Pibo session/trace view models and preserving the Web Chat UI as the full-featured primary interface.

## Background / Current State

Pibo already exposes terminal-related commands such as `pibo tui`, `pibo tui:routed`, and `pibo client`. The Web Chat UI provides the richer browser session interface, including the compact terminal view and trace-derived session rendering.

The investigation in `docs/reports/ink-cli-session-subset-report.md` found that Ink can render a native terminal interface using React components, but it cannot directly reuse DOM-specific Web UI components such as `div`, `button`, Tailwind classes, `react-virtuoso`, `lucide-react`, `react-markdown`, or `@uiw/react-json-view`.

The durable reuse point is the shared data and view-model layer: `PiboSessionTraceView`, trace events, and compact terminal rows.

## Scope

### In Scope

- A native interactive terminal session UI built with Ink.
- Session-oriented chat workflows: start session, select session, send message, view streamed output.
- Minimal room/session selection where supported by local data or session source.
- Agent/profile selection via CLI interaction, for example `/agent`.
- Compact terminal transcript rendering using shared terminal view-model data.
- Basic Slash Commands: `/help`, `/new`, `/session`, `/agent`, `/status`, `/clear`, `/exit`, `/quit`.
- Recovery/SSH use where Web UI is unavailable.
- Non-TTY fallback behavior for clear errors or plain output.
- Tests for shared row generation and Ink rendering snapshots.

### Out of Scope

- Replacing the Web Chat UI — the Web UI remains the main interface.
- Projects and project dashboards.
- Workflows and Workflow/XState visualizations.
- Cron job management.
- Ralph job management.
- Agent Designer or agent profile editing UI.
- Full settings UI.
- Full context-file or knowledge-management UI.
- Browser-style modals, hover controls, drag-and-drop, tables, SVG icons, or DOM markdown rendering.
- Direct reuse of Web DOM presentation components inside Ink.

## Requirements

### Requirement: CLI is a subset of Web Chat, not a replacement

The CLI Session UI MUST present a reduced session/chat workflow derived from the Web Chat UI while leaving the Web UI as Pibo's full-featured control center.

#### Current

The Web Chat UI contains session views, compact terminal rendering, workflow view registration, settings, context, projects, and other browser-first controls. Existing terminal commands do not provide the target session-selection and compact Ink view.

#### Target

The CLI supports only the session/chat subset. Web-only capabilities remain discoverable and operable in the Web UI, not recreated in V1 CLI.

#### Acceptance

A reviewer can inspect the CLI documentation and implementation and verify that project, workflow, Cron, Ralph, and Agent Designer workflows are not exposed through the V1 interactive Ink surface.

#### Scenario: Operator uses CLI over SSH

- GIVEN an operator has SSH access to a machine with Pibo installed
- AND the Web UI is not running
- WHEN the operator starts the CLI Session UI
- THEN the operator can select or create a Pibo session and send messages
- AND the CLI does not require the Web UI to be open.

### Requirement: CLI uses Ink presentation components

The CLI Session UI MUST use Ink primitives for terminal presentation and MUST NOT depend on browser DOM components for rendering.

#### Acceptance

Terminal UI components render through Ink `Box`, `Text`, and terminal-safe helpers. They do not import `react-dom`, `react-virtuoso`, Tailwind CSS classes, `lucide-react`, `@uiw/react-json-view`, or browser-only markdown renderers.

### Requirement: CLI and Web share view-model/data logic

The CLI Session UI MUST reuse shared Pibo trace/session data and compact terminal row models instead of reimplementing trace-to-row mapping only for CLI.

#### Acceptance

The CLI transcript renderer consumes `PiboSessionTraceView` and shared `CompactTerminalRow`-style records. Row-generation tests cover both Web-compatible and CLI-compatible usage.

### Requirement: Web UI remains behaviorally unchanged

Implementing the CLI Session UI MUST NOT force visual or behavioral changes to the existing Web Chat UI.

#### Acceptance

Existing Chat Web typecheck/build tests pass after shared view-model extraction. Web terminal view imports may change, but rendered behavior must remain intentionally unchanged unless a separate Web UI spec approves a change.

### Requirement: Session selection is CLI-native

The CLI Session UI MUST let a user select or create a session with terminal controls and Slash Commands.

#### Acceptance

`/session` opens a terminal selection flow. `/new` creates a new session flow. Both flows return to the transcript after completion or cancellation.

### Requirement: Agent selection is CLI-native and limited

The CLI Session UI MUST support selecting an existing agent/profile but MUST NOT include profile editing or Agent Designer behavior in V1.

#### Acceptance

`/agent` lists available profiles from the canonical profile source for the session source. Selecting one applies it to new or current session behavior according to runtime capability. The CLI does not create, edit, or delete profiles.

### Requirement: Transcript renders live compact session state

The CLI Session UI MUST show user messages, assistant output, tool calls, tool results, yielded runs, and errors in a compact terminal transcript.

#### Acceptance

Given a trace view containing a user message, streaming/final assistant message, tool call, tool result, yielded run, and error, the Ink renderer produces bounded terminal output that includes each row with status markers and does not crash on missing optional fields.

### Requirement: Slash Commands are explicit and bounded

The CLI Session UI MUST expose a small, documented Slash Command surface and reject unsupported commands with clear feedback.

#### Acceptance

`/help` lists V1 commands. Unknown commands display an error and do not fall through to unrelated Pi or Web behavior. `/exit` and `/quit` terminate cleanly.

### Requirement: CLI supports recovery and non-TTY behavior

The CLI Session UI MUST fail clearly when required local state is unavailable and MUST avoid corrupting terminal state.

#### Acceptance

If no session source is available, the CLI displays an actionable message. If stdout is not a TTY, the command does not start a broken interactive UI and either exits with a clear error or uses an explicitly documented non-interactive mode.

## Edge Cases

- No sessions exist yet.
- Room list is empty or unavailable in local mode.
- Agent/profile list is empty or profile resolution fails.
- Current session is deleted or unavailable while selected.
- Runtime sends malformed or incomplete trace data.
- Terminal width is small.
- Large sessions exceed the default render window.
- User presses `Ctrl+C` during streaming.
- Session source disconnects or Web/Gateway source becomes unavailable.

## Constraints

- **Primary interface:** Web Chat UI remains the authoritative full-control interface.
- **Presentation:** Ink components are required for terminal rendering.
- **Reuse boundary:** Share data/view models, not DOM components.
- **Performance:** V1 must render a bounded transcript window, not the full unbounded session history.
- **Compatibility:** Existing `pibo tui` and `pibo tui:routed` behavior must not be broken without an explicit migration plan.
- **Security / privacy:** CLI output must not reveal more session/tool detail by default than existing Web compact terminal and debug conventions allow.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] SC-001: A user can run the CLI Session UI from a shell and create or select a Pibo session without opening Web Chat.
- [ ] SC-002: The CLI renders compact transcript rows from shared `PiboSessionTraceView`/terminal row data.
- [ ] SC-003: `/help`, `/new`, `/session`, `/agent`, `/status`, `/clear`, `/exit`, and `/quit` are implemented and documented.
- [ ] SC-004: V1 CLI excludes Projects, Workflows, Cron, Ralph, Agent Designer, and full Settings surfaces.
- [ ] SC-005: Web Chat UI builds and behaves as before after shared view-model extraction.
- [ ] SC-006: Ink rendering has snapshot/string tests for representative trace rows.

## Assumptions and Open Questions

### V1 Scope Decisions

- V1 command name is `pibo tui:sessions`.
- V1 uses a local/direct session source first and keeps an interface open for later Gateway-backed operation.
- V1 Slash Commands are `/help`, `/new`, `/session`, `/agent`, `/status`, `/clear`, `/exit`, and `/quit`.
- `/model`, `/thinking`, `/fork`, and `/details` are later-scope commands unless a separate spec approves them.
- Room support in V1 depends on what the chosen local/direct session source can list without Web UI.

### Open Questions

- What exact maximum row window should the first renderer use?
- Which profile list is canonical for local/direct mode?
