# PRD Catalog: Pibo Workflow System V1

**Status:** Draft  
**Created:** 2026-05-10  
**Source change:** `docs/specs/changes/pibo-workflow-system-v1/`

This directory translates the Pibo Workflow System V1 proposal, spec, design, task list, and references into implementation-grade PRDs.

## Global Decisions Inherited by All PRDs

- Workflows are TypeScript code using the Pibo Workflow Framework in `packages/workflows`.
- The Workflow Registry is the canonical V1 catalog for workflow definitions, handlers, adapters, guards, prompt assets, human actions, plugin registrations, and capability metadata.
- The runtime uses a fresh SQLite database named `pibo-workflows.sqlite` for workflow-specific facts.
- Normal Pibo/Pi session traces, tool calls, spans, transcripts, and session records stay in existing stores.
- V1 structured ports use the OpenAI Structured Outputs / tool-calling JSON Schema subset.
- Agent nodes run through normal Pibo Runtime/session routing with explicit Agent Designer profiles.
- Adapters are registered deterministic TypeScript adapters only; hidden coercion is out of scope.
- Backtracking is allowed only through explicit guarded back-edges or retry policies with `maxAttempts`.
- XState is a dependency for projection, visualization, inspection, local orchestration support, and future editing; it is not durable truth.
- Human waits use durable Pibo wait tokens.

## Second-Pass Coverage Rule

For implementation, give agents this whole directory, not a single PRD. `09-implementation-completeness-contract.md` is the mandatory cross-check: any implementation missing a MUST item there is incomplete, even if an earlier PRD describes the area at a higher level.

## Discovery Notes

The source specs define the core problem, solution, technical constraints, and implementation defaults. Business budget and external deadline are not specified in the source docs; these PRDs therefore use feature-completeness, safety, and validation gates instead of calendar or budget gates.
