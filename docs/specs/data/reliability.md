# Scope

pibo-events.sqlite stream, consumer, job, dead-job, and run records; atomic claims; monotonic run settlement; notification/read/ack state; restart reconciliation.

This specification describes implemented behavior at the traceability commit. Planned behavior and contracts assigned to related concepts are outside its normative scope.

# Current behavior

- Persistence and models: pibo_event_stream; pibo_event_consumers; pibo_jobs; pibo_dead_jobs; pibo_runs; inline payload_json/result_json; run states queued/running/completed/failed/timed_out/cancelled; tracked/detached completion policy.
- Routes and protocols: No HTTP route or external wire protocol is owned.
- State transitions: appendOnce deduplicates by event ID/idempotency key and stream IDs are monotonic. Consumer offsets advance by MAX and prune preserves rows needed by named consumers unless destructive behavior is explicit. Jobs move pending to generation-fenced leased running, then ack/retry/fail; per-job `maxAttempts` is enforced before another claim, exhausted work enters the dead-letter queue, and replay creates a new live job. Yielded-run job enqueue, claim, and run-row insertion commit atomically. Startup reconciliation moves only expired ownerless run jobs without matching run rows to the dead-letter queue with `orphan_run_job`; it is idempotent and never replays work. Durable output delivery uses versioned envelopes, heartbeat renewal, idempotent projection receipts, bounded recovery batches, and sanitized quarantine for malformed payloads. Run terminal transitions are guarded; cancel wins over late complete; tracked terminal ack consumes notifications.
- Failure and security: Claims require exact worker identity, generation, and unexpired lease for heartbeat/ack/retry/fail; stale owners cannot destructively settle work. Output identity collisions and permanent failures dead-letter after one attempt, while mixed retryable work remains recoverable. A single collision degrades output-integrity health, preventing recurring collisions from remaining a count-only signal. Run lookup and mutation are scoped by controller Pibo Session ID. Wait is bounded; cancellation tooling waits up to 15 seconds for execution settlement before committing cancellation.
- Compatibility: Tracked runs notify until consumed; detached runs remain inspectable without notifications. Pruning removes only detached terminal or consumed tracked runs after TTL.

# Requirements and invariants

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-REL-001

Reliability events SHALL append in monotonic order and deduplicate by event ID or idempotency key; consumer offsets SHALL never move backward.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-REL-002

Job claims SHALL be atomic and lease/worker/generation exact; retry backoff, per-job attempt exhaustion, dead-lettering, replay, delivery receipts, and versioned output-persistence recovery SHALL be durable and bounded.

Web semantic output retains checkpoints after canonical V2 identity and reliability append. Any persisted or dead-lettered output identity collision SHALL produce a degraded integrity-health result at the threshold of one while preserving permanent one-attempt dead-letter classification. A reconstructible reliability payload does not require its own checkpoint. A committed delivery receipt is authoritative for completed side effects, so it does not require a further full-envelope rewrite before job acknowledgment. Existing replay, claim fencing and duplicate render identity remain unchanged.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-REL-003

Run state SHALL be controller-session scoped, monotonic, and idempotent; terminal cancel SHALL win over late completion and cancellation SHALL commit only after bounded execution settlement.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-REL-004

Tracked notification state SHALL preserve causal origin, remain repeatable until acknowledgment, and become consumed on terminal read/ack; detached runs SHALL not notify.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-REL-005

Restart reconciliation and cleanup SHALL classify deadline/retry outcomes without regressing terminal state; pruning SHALL retain unconsumed tracked runs.

## Requirement: WP02-DATA-REL-006: Run jobs and run records remain atomic or terminally reconciled

Creating a yielded run SHALL commit its `pibo_jobs` row, claim, and `pibo_runs` row in one transaction. Startup and explicit maintenance reconciliation SHALL move an expired `runs` job with no matching run row to the dead-letter queue with reason `orphan_run_job`, without touching an unexpired owner or a job with a valid matching run. Repeated reconciliation SHALL be idempotent and SHALL NOT replay side effects. Reliability inspection SHALL distinguish effective claim liveness and expose degraded orphan/DLQ counts without treating orphans as active yielded runs.

Related ownership boundaries:

- SPC-ORCH-001 owns yielded execution orchestration and resource admission.
- SPC-GW-001 owns router actions that invoke run cancellation.
- Process/cgroup isolation belongs to resource/runtime owners, not this store.
- SPC-DATA-001 owns product history; reliability notifications may be projected into it.

# Failure and security behavior

- Claims require exact worker ownership and unexpired leases for heartbeat/ack/retry/fail.
- Run lookup and mutation are scoped by controller Pibo Session ID.
- Wait is bounded; cancellation tooling waits up to 15 seconds for execution settlement before committing cancellation.

# Known limits

- Non-current claim excluded: claim reliability payload files or payload buckets; payload and result values are inline JSON columns in pibo-events.sqlite.
- Non-current claim excluded: assign cgroup/process isolation policy to the reliability store.
- Non-current claim excluded: say kill always cancels yielded runs; router kill and kill_all differ.
- Current limit or evidence gap: No separate size cap for inline reliability payload_json/result_json was found in the store; document this as a current limit rather than inventing bounded payload files.

# Verification and traceability

Source symbols and named tests are bound to commit `2b7b2a7c31be0de7b326e5ef6b82f01ea2b51a3d`. Requirement confidence measures trace quality; it does not claim that an external, browser, real-provider, or Pibo2 check ran.

Package verification commands:

- `npm run build`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `node scripts/run-test-suite.mjs test/reliability-store.test.mjs test/runs.test.mjs`

# Related concepts

- SPC-ORCH-001 owns yielded execution orchestration and resource admission.
- SPC-GW-001 owns router actions that invoke run cancellation.
- Process/cgroup isolation belongs to resource/runtime owners, not this store.
- SPC-DATA-001 owns product history; reliability notifications may be projected into it.
