# Pibo Tools

`pibo tools` manages curated external CLI tools. It is separate from the pibo profile skill system and from MCP servers.

The tool registry answers three questions:

- which CLI tools does pibo know?
- which of them are installed locally?
- which usage guides can an agent request on demand?

Guides are printed by the CLI. They are not loaded into every agent profile.

List-style commands use compact line output so agents can discover the next step without reading full guides. Detailed instructions stay behind explicit `show`, `doctor`, and `guide` commands.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev -- tools list
npm run dev -- tools installed
npm run dev -- tools show browser-use
npm run dev -- tools doctor browser-use
npm run dev -- tools install browser-use
npm run dev -- tools remove browser-use
npm run dev -- tools guides browser-use
npm run dev -- tools guide browser-use browser-use
npm run dev -- tools guide browser-use remote-browser
npm run dev -- tools path browser-use
npm run dev -- tools env browser-use
npm run dev -- tools browser-use
npm run dev -- tools browser-use targets
npm run dev -- tools browser-use attach-chat
npm run dev -- tools browser-use lease acquire
```

## Browser Use

The first curated tool is `browser-use`, a browser automation CLI.

Pibo installs it on demand into:

```text
~/.pibo/tools/browser-use/.venv
```

Browser Use state is isolated under:

```text
~/.pibo/tools/browser-use/home
```

By default, the Pibo Browser Use wrapper starts a Pibo-managed persistent Chrome profile through CDP:

```text
~/.pibo/tools/browser-use/home/chrome-profiles/PIBo
```

This is intentionally different from upstream `browser-use --profile`, which can copy Chrome profiles into a temporary user-data directory. Sign-ins made through the default Pibo wrapper path persist across Browser Use daemon restarts and shell sessions. Use `--fresh-profile` only when a disposable temporary browser profile is wanted.

For authenticated Chat Web App testing, use isolated Browser Use leases instead of sharing one long-lived browser-use session between agents:

```bash
eval "$(npm run --silent dev -- tools browser-use lease acquire --app pibo-chat --owner "$USER")"
browser-use state
```

The lease prints shell exports for a cloned authenticated Chrome user-data directory and a dedicated `PIBO_BROWSER_USE_SESSION`. In that shell, later `browser-use` commands use the leased session by default.

Prepare or refresh the authenticated template before acquiring leases:

```bash
eval "$(npm run --silent dev -- tools browser-use auth-template env)"
browser-use --headed open http://4788.192.168.0.204.sslip.io/apps/chat
```

Sign in once in that template browser, close it, then acquire leases from normal agent shells. If lease acquisition reports that no template profile exists, repeat the template preparation step.

Additional lease helper commands:

```bash
npm run dev -- tools browser-use
npm run dev -- tools browser-use auth-template path
npm run dev -- tools browser-use auth-template env
npm run dev -- tools browser-use lease list
npm run dev -- tools browser-use lease release <lease-id>
npm run dev -- tools browser-use lease reap-stale
```

Use `pibo tools browser-use` as the compact discovery entrypoint. `auth-template` helps prepare or locate the authenticated Chrome user-data-dir template. `lease list`, `lease release`, and `lease reap-stale` are the operator surface for inspecting and cleaning up isolated authenticated browser slots.

For low-level Chat Web debugging, prefer an already-open authenticated browser over launching a new profile. Start with CDP target discovery:

```bash
npm run dev -- tools browser-use targets
npm run dev -- tools browser-use attach-chat
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:56663/json/list
```

Inspect Chat Web targets before interacting with them. The usable target is the one that is authenticated and has the composer textarea; the first target may be unauthenticated, stale, or attached to a different gateway. `attach-chat` prints shell exports for the best existing authenticated Chat target. If Browser Use cannot attach cleanly or MCP resources are not visible, connect directly to the target WebSocket from `targets`, `attach-chat`, or `/json/list` and use CDP `Runtime.evaluate`, `Network`, and DOM inspection.

The installer uses `uv` to create the virtual environment and install the pinned package `browser-use[cli]==0.12.6`. The version is pinned so the Browser Use CLI surface stays aligned with the bundled guides. On Linux hosts without a detected desktop display, `pibo tools install browser-use` now provisions `xvfb`, `xauth`, `x11-xserver-utils`, and a `pibo-xvfb.service` virtual display automatically when run as root. Browser Use system setup remains visible through `pibo tools doctor browser-use`; if Browser Use reports missing optional components, install them explicitly for the workflow that needs them.

## Requirements

`pibo tools doctor browser-use` checks:

- whether `uv` is available
- whether Python is available through `uv`
- whether the virtual environment exists
- whether the `browser-use` executable exists
- whether a local Linux desktop display can be detected
- whether `browser-use doctor` succeeds

If `uv` is missing:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

If Python is missing:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv

# macOS
brew install python

# Windows PowerShell
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

## Usage Guides

Agents can discover available guides:

```bash
npm run dev -- tools guides browser-use
```

Then print one guide:

```bash
npm run dev -- tools guide browser-use browser-use
```

The default browser-use guide describes local browser automation. The `remote-browser` guide describes remote or sandboxed browser workflows.

## Shell Environment

Use `path` to print the executable path:

```bash
npm run dev -- tools path browser-use
```

Use `env` to print shell exports:

```bash
npm run dev -- tools env browser-use
```

On Linux/macOS this prints:

```bash
export PATH=".../home/bin:.../.venv/bin:$PATH"
export BROWSER_USE_HOME=".../home"
```

On Linux desktops, `env` also prints detected browser display variables when available:

```bash
export DISPLAY=":0"
export WAYLAND_DISPLAY="wayland-0"
export XAUTHORITY="/run/user/1000/.mutter-Xwaylandauth..."
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/1000"
export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus"
```

Apply these exports once in a persistent Browser Use shell, then keep using that same shell for later `browser-use` commands:

```bash
eval "$(npm run --silent dev -- tools env browser-use)"
browser-use doctor
browser-use --headed --session debug open https://example.com
```

If you start a new shell, apply the exports once again before running Browser Use. The exports are shell-local and are not written system-wide.

If no desktop display is detected and the install command is not able to provision one automatically, `pibo tools install browser-use` and `pibo tools doctor browser-use` warn that headed mode is unavailable. Headless Browser Use still works:

```bash
browser-use --session debug open https://example.com
```

To intentionally use a real local Chrome user data directory instead of the Pibo-managed one, set `PIBO_BROWSER_USE_CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR` before starting the Browser Use session.
