# Pibo Architecture

Pibo is a thin TypeScript harness around Pi Coding Agent. Pi remains the inner engine for model turns, tools, streaming, sessions, and compaction. Pibo owns the outer product boundary: profiles, plugin registration, channels, routing, session bindings, and transport-specific adapters.

## Design Principles

- Keep Pi Coding Agent embedded as the execution engine, not expanded into the whole product.
- Keep pibo responsible for product boundaries: profiles, plugins, channels, auth, policy, and routing.
- Keep optional integrations opt-in. External MCP servers, Python runtimes, and third-party CLIs are installed only when a user asks for them.
- Keep runtime configuration explicit and local. Project config lives in `.pibo/config.json`; MCP server definitions live in `mcp_servers.json`; installed external CLI tools live under `~/.pibo/tools`.
- Prefer ordinary, inspectable boundaries over hidden coupling: plugins register capabilities, channels translate transports, and MCP servers remain external processes.

## Core Boundary

```text
Channel / Tool / Client
  -> Pibo event
  -> Session router
  -> Routed Pi runtime
  -> Normalized Pibo output event
  -> Channel / Client
```

The core contracts live in:

- `src/core/events.ts` for message, execution, and output events.
- `src/core/profiles.ts` for profile, tool, skill, and context-file selection.
- `src/core/runtime.ts` for creating a Pi Coding Agent runtime from a profile.
- `src/core/session-router.ts` and `src/core/routed-session.ts` for per-session queues and execution actions.

Message events are user input. They are queued per session and sent into Pi.

Execution events are wrapper-level actions such as status, queue clear, abort, dispose, and Pi session controls. They are not model messages. Parameterized execution actions use typed params in `src/core/events.ts`; JSON transports validate those params at the protocol boundary before the router sees them.

## Pi Session Controls

Pibo follows Pi Coding Agent's session behavior instead of reimplementing it. The stable `sessionKey` belongs to the channel route, while `sessionId` is the short technical Pi session identity used for Pi persistence and provider cache affinity. The active Pi session underneath a route may still change through fork, clone, or switch actions.

The built-in session actions are:

- `session.current` returns the active Pi session id, session file, leaf id, cwd, and parent session file.
- `session.list` lists persisted Pi sessions for the current workspace/session directory.
- `session.fork_candidates` returns user message entry ids that can be used as fork targets.
- `session.fork` calls Pi's fork behavior for a selected user message and makes the fork the active Pi session for the same route.
- `session.clone` clones the current leaf and makes the clone active for the same route.
- `session.tree` returns Pi's current session tree plus the active leaf.
- `session.tree_navigate` moves the active leaf inside the current Pi session tree.
- `session.switch` switches the active Pi runtime to a persisted session file.

Fork and clone intentionally replace the active Pi runtime inside the existing routed session, matching Pi Coding Agent. The previous session file is preserved by Pi and returned in the action result. Channels can keep their own UI history and call `session.switch` when they want to move back to an older fork or clone.

Tree navigation stays inside the current Pi session file. It changes the active leaf and returns any editor text Pi would prefill for a user-message target. Channels decide how to render tree selection; Pibo only exposes the typed infrastructure.

## Plugin Layer

Plugins are static and internal for now. They register capabilities into `PiboPluginRegistry`:

- tools
- subagents
- skills
- context files
- profiles
- gateway execution actions
- event listeners
- channels

The registry is a catalog. It does not run sessions and does not own transport. Runtime code consumes the catalog when it creates profiles, exposes actions, or starts plugin channels.

## Subagents

Subagents are profile-scoped capabilities, exposed to Pi as generated tools. A plugin registers a subagent definition, and a profile chooses which subagents are visible in the same builder pattern used for tools, skills, and context files.

```text
Profile
  -> tools
  -> subagents
  -> skills
  -> context files
```

A subagent definition points at another registered profile. That target profile may have its own tools, skills, context files, and subagents. Nothing is inherited automatically from the parent profile; each target profile declares its own capabilities.

At runtime, each subagent call creates or reuses a normal routed session:

```text
parent-session
  -> pibo_subagent_<name> tool
  -> parent-session::sub::<name>::<threadKey>
  -> Session router
  -> Pi runtime for targetProfile
```

If `threadKey` is omitted, pibo creates a new subagent session. If the caller passes the same `threadKey` again, the same subagent session is continued, which allows multi-turn delegation. The generated session key can be used through the gateway like any other session key while the router is running.

Subagent tools support `sync` and `async` modes. Sync mode waits for the correlated assistant reply and returns it to the calling agent. Async mode enqueues the message and returns the child `sessionKey` and event id immediately. A depth guard prevents accidental recursive subagent loops.

## Yielded Runs

Profiles with enabled subagents also receive run-control tools. These are agent-facing tools, not gateway actions:

```text
pibo_subagent_start
pibo_run_list
pibo_run_status
pibo_run_wait
pibo_run_read
pibo_run_cancel
pibo_run_ack
```

`pibo_subagent_start` starts a subagent message as a yielded run and returns a `runId`. The run registry in the session router maps that `runId` to the child `sessionKey` and input `eventId`, then completes or fails the run when the router observes the correlated child output.

Yielded runs use `tracked` by default. Tracked runs create compact `<pibo_run_notification>` service messages for the parent agent when they start, finish, fail, or remain unconsumed across natural turn boundaries. Notifications contain only run ids and summaries; the agent must call `pibo_run_read` to retrieve the full result. `detached` runs are explicit fire-and-forget work: they remain inspectable with `includeDetached`, but they do not create automatic reminders.

The router keeps one active parent turn at a time by enqueuing notifications as normal service messages. Service notifications do not immediately re-trigger themselves. Running runs are cancelled when their owning session or router is disposed, detached terminal runs are pruned after a short TTL, and consumed terminal tracked runs are kept briefly for debugging.

## Channels

Channels are plugin-owned adapters. They translate an external transport into pibo events and translate pibo output events back to that transport.

The channel context intentionally exposes only:

- `emit(event)` to route a `PiboInputEvent`.
- `subscribe(listener)` to observe `PiboOutputEvent` values.
- `resolveSession(input)` to create or reuse a persistent binding.
- `getGatewayActions()` to discover execution actions for channel UIs.

Session bindings are stored in SQLite by default at `.pibo/session-bindings.sqlite`. A binding keeps a stable, semantic `sessionKey` separate from the technical `sessionId`, original agent profile, channel identity, and optional parent session identity. Channels and tools route by `sessionKey`; Pi and provider cache keys use `sessionId`.

## Auth

Auth is a thin core service boundary exposed to channels through `PiboChannelContext`. The gateway validates that channels marked with `auth.mode: "required"` have an auth service before they start.

The first concrete implementation is Better Auth, registered through a built-in plugin for the web gateway path. It is intentionally not loaded by the default local gateway so trusted-local TCP and remote-agent flows do not require Google OAuth configuration. Web apps always require the web auth service, including localhost. The Auth plugin owns identity and allowlist checks; it does not own chat UI or agent routing.

Runtime config lives in `.pibo/config.json` and is managed through `pibo config ...`. Better Auth reads this local config; environment variables are not part of the auth configuration path.

```text
Same-Origin Web Host
  -> Better Auth /api/auth/*
  -> Chat Web App /apps/chat and /api/chat/*
  -> auth/session policy
  -> resolveSession(channel=chat-web, externalId=userId)
  -> Session router
```

The V1 chat web app uses Better Auth Google sign-in for every request path, including localhost. The authenticated Better Auth user id maps to the session binding external id, producing `chat-web:<userId>`.

The auth boundary is enforced before channel input reaches the session router:

- no Better Auth session returns `401`
- a missing or empty `auth.allowedEmails` allowlist prevents Better Auth startup
- a Google account outside `auth.allowedEmails` returns `403`
- allowed users resolve a persistent `chat-web` session binding
- chat mutation routes require same-origin JSON requests

Google OAuth redirect URIs remain per deployment. Local QA can use `http://localhost:4788/api/auth/callback/google`; internet-facing deployments must configure their own `https://<host>/api/auth/callback/google` in Google Cloud Console and set `auth.baseURL` to the same origin. Pibo does not attempt wildcard redirect support because Google requires exact redirect URI matching for web-server OAuth. Private LAN IP Google OAuth redirects are intentionally not a supported V1 mode.

## Web Host And Apps

The same-origin web path is intentionally split:

- `pibo.web-host` starts the HTTP channel and routes `/api/auth/*` plus registered web apps.
- `pibo.chat-web` registers the current chat UI/API as a web app.
- Future apps can register additional web apps without becoming part of the Auth plugin.

This avoids iframe and cross-origin complexity for V1. Apps can use normal same-origin cookies and call their own API routes while sharing the gateway auth boundary.

## Remote Agent Channel

The built-in `pibo.remote-agent` plugin starts the local `remote-agent` channel on `127.0.0.1:4790`.

```text
Controller
  -> remote_attach(sessionName, profile)
  -> capabilities(gateway actions)
  -> remote_input(message | execution)
  -> Session router
  -> Pi runtime
  -> remote_event
```

The reusable pieces are:

- `src/remote/protocol.ts` for newline-delimited frame types.
- `src/remote/channel.ts` for the server-side channel.
- `src/remote/session-client.ts` for client-side attach, discovery, request/response correlation, and remote events.
- `src/remote/client.ts` for the minimal line-based debug client.

## Remote TUI Example

`src/remote/examples/tui-controller.ts` is intentionally an example, not a product direction. It proves that a Pi Coding Agent TUI can act as a local remote controller by using Pi extension hooks:

- `session_start` attaches to the `remote-agent` channel.
- `input` intercepts normal TUI input and forwards it as remote messages.
- discovered gateway actions are registered as Pi extension slash commands.
- autocomplete is filtered to the remote commands plus `/quit`.
- remote output is rendered back into the TUI as styled custom messages.

This is useful as a reference for future channel adapters, but Pi TUI is not treated as the long-term primary remote UI. A dedicated web or terminal client can reuse the same channel and `RemoteAgentSessionClient` without coupling itself to Pi TUI internals.

## Operator CLIs

The operator CLIs are optimized for agent-driven discovery. Each level should answer only the question for that level and point to the next command. Broad usage guides, schemas, and environment details are printed only by explicit deeper commands such as `schema`, `show`, `doctor`, or `guide`.

`pibo mcp` is a local operator tool for discovering and calling external MCP servers from the shell. It is separate from the pibo plugin/runtime boundary: MCP servers are configured in `mcp_servers.json`, not in `PiboPluginRegistry`, and their tools are invoked directly by the CLI. The usage guide lives in `docs/mcp.md`.

`pibo tools` is the matching operator surface for curated external CLI tools. These are not MCP servers and are not Pibo profile skills. A tool entry can install an isolated runtime, expose doctor/path/env commands, and print on-demand guides for agents. The first curated tool is `browser-use`, installed under `~/.pibo/tools/browser-use` with its own Python venv and tool home.

## MCP CLI

The CLI supports:

- stdio MCP servers through `command`, `args`, `env`, and `cwd`.
- HTTP MCP servers through `url` and optional `headers`.
- per-server `allowedTools` and `disabledTools` glob filters.
- listing tools, inspecting server/tool schemas, grep-style tool search, and JSON tool calls.
- short-lived daemon connections for faster repeated calls, disabled with `MCP_NO_DAEMON=1`.

The config helper commands live under `pibo mcp config ...` and can create, show, add, and remove server definitions. The runtime lookup order is explicit `-c/--config`, `MCP_CONFIG_PATH`, project-local `mcp_servers.json`, then the user-level MCP config paths.

`pibo mcp registry ...` is a thin convenience layer over the same config file. Registry entries are curated presets for optional MCP servers and are not active until installed. Python-based presets get isolated virtual environments under `~/.pibo/mcp-tools/<name>`, managed on demand through `uv`. Installing a preset writes a normal `mcpServers` entry, so the runtime path stays identical to manually added servers. The registry currently has no bundled presets.

The MCP daemon keeps expensive stdio server connections warm between CLI invocations. It is a local convenience cache only; server state and security still belong to the configured MCP server.

## CLI Tools

`pibo tools` keeps curated command-line tools discoverable without pushing their usage instructions into every agent context. Installed tool runtimes live under `~/.pibo/tools/<name>`. A tool can expose one or more guides, but those guides are only printed when requested through the CLI.

The first bundled tool preset is `browser-use`, pinned to `browser-use[cli]==0.12.6` so its CLI surface matches the bundled guide text. Its guides are available through:

```bash
npm run dev -- tools guides browser-use
npm run dev -- tools guide browser-use browser-use
npm run dev -- tools guide browser-use remote-browser
```

## Current Scripts

```bash
npm run gateway
npm run gateway:web
npm run client -- <sessionKey>
npm run remote -- <sessionName> [profile]
npm run remote:line -- <sessionName> [profile]
npm run tui -- [profile]
npm run profile -- [profile]
npm run dev -- mcp
npm run dev -- tools
```

`npm run remote` runs the Pi-TUI proof-of-concept controller. `npm run remote:line` runs the simpler debug client.
