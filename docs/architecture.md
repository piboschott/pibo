# Pibo Architecture

Pibo is a thin TypeScript harness around Pi Coding Agent. Pi remains the inner engine for model turns, tools, streaming, sessions, and compaction. Pibo owns the outer product boundary: profiles, plugin registration, channels, routing, Pibo Sessions, and transport-specific adapters.

## Design Principles

- Keep Pi Coding Agent embedded as the execution engine, not expanded into the whole product.
- Keep pibo responsible for product boundaries: profiles, plugins, channels, auth, policy, and routing.
- Keep optional integrations opt-in. External MCP servers, Python runtimes, and third-party CLIs are installed only when a user asks for them.
- Keep runtime configuration explicit and local. Project config lives in `.pibo/config.json`; MCP server definitions live in `mcp_servers.json`; installed external CLI tools live under `~/.pibo/tools`.
- Prefer ordinary, inspectable boundaries over hidden coupling: plugins register capabilities, channels translate transports, and MCP servers remain external processes.

## Core Boundary

```text
Channel / Tool / Client
  -> Pibo event
  -> Session router
  -> Routed Pi runtime
  -> Normalized Pibo output event
  -> Channel / Client
```

The core contracts live in:

- `src/core/events.ts` for message, execution, and output events.
- `src/core/profiles.ts` for profile, tool, skill, and context-file selection.
- `src/core/runtime.ts` for creating a Pi Coding Agent runtime from a profile.
- `src/core/session-router.ts` and `src/core/routed-session.ts` for per-session queues and execution actions.

Message events are user input. They are queued per session and sent into Pi.

Execution events are wrapper-level actions such as status, queue clear, abort, dispose, and Pi session controls. They are not model messages. Parameterized execution actions use typed params in `src/core/events.ts`; JSON transports validate those params at the protocol boundary before the router sees them.

Output events are normalized router events. Assistant text and thinking are separate streams: `assistant_delta` carries visible assistant text, while `thinking_started`, `thinking_delta`, and `thinking_finished` carry model thinking traces when the provider emits them. `thinking_finished` ends only the thinking block; the agent turn stays active until `message_finished` or `session_error`. Channels decide independently whether to display thinking; the router always preserves the event boundary so web, gateway, and local TUI clients can opt in without changing Pi runtime behavior.

## Pibo And Pi Sessions

Pibo separates product session identity from Pi Coding Agent's technical session identity. `PiboSession.id` is the stable product route used by channels, APIs, UI, access control, and event correlation. `PiboSession.piSessionId` is the Pi Coding Agent session id used for Pi persistence, transcript files, provider cache affinity, fork, clone, switch, tree navigation, and compaction.

Pibo Sessions are stored in `.pibo/pibo-sessions.sqlite`. They carry channel, kind, profile, owner scope, optional `parentId` for true hierarchy, optional `originId` for fork/clone derivation, workspace, title, and plugin metadata. Core code must not parse meaning out of the Pibo Session ID.

## Pi Session Controls

Pibo exposes Pi session controls through typed execution actions while keeping the selected Pibo Session as the route.

The built-in session actions are:

- `session.current` returns the active `piSessionId`, session file, leaf id, cwd, and parent session file.
- `session.list` lists persisted Pi sessions for the current workspace/session directory.
- `session.fork_candidates` returns user message entry ids that can be used as fork targets.
- `session.fork` calls Pi's fork behavior for a selected user message and returns a new visible Pibo Session with `kind: "branch"` and `originId` pointing at the source session.
- `session.clone` clones the current leaf and returns a new visible Pibo Session with `kind: "branch"` and `originId` pointing at the source session.
- `session.tree` returns Pi's current session tree plus the active leaf.
- `session.tree_navigate` moves the active leaf inside the current Pi session tree.
- `session.switch` switches the active Pi runtime to a persisted session file.

Fork and clone intentionally become new product sessions instead of silently replacing the original route. The previous session file is preserved by Pi and returned in the action result. Channels can select the returned Pibo Session ID when they want to continue on the branch.

Tree navigation stays inside the current Pi session file. It changes the active leaf and returns any editor text Pi would prefill for a user-message target. Channels decide how to render tree selection; Pibo only exposes the typed infrastructure.

## Plugin Layer

Plugins are static and internal for now. They register capabilities into `PiboPluginRegistry`:

- tools
- subagents
- skills
- context files
- profiles
- gateway execution actions
- event listeners
- channels

The registry is a catalog. It does not run sessions and does not own transport. Runtime code consumes the catalog when it creates profiles, exposes actions, or starts plugin channels.

## Subagents

Subagents are profile-scoped capabilities, exposed to Pi as generated tools. A plugin registers a subagent definition, and a profile chooses which subagents are visible in the same builder pattern used for tools, skills, and context files.

```text
Profile
  -> tools
  -> subagents
  -> skills
  -> context files
```

A subagent definition points at another registered profile. That target profile may have its own tools, skills, context files, and subagents. Nothing is inherited automatically from the parent profile; each target profile declares its own capabilities.

At runtime, each subagent call creates or reuses a normal routed session:

```text
parent Pibo Session
  -> pibo_subagent_<name> tool
  -> child Pibo Session with channel=pibo.subagents, kind=subagent, parentId=<parent id>
  -> Session router
  -> Pi runtime for targetProfile
```

If `threadKey` is omitted, pibo creates a new subagent session. If the caller passes the same `threadKey` again, the same subagent session is continued, which allows multi-turn delegation. Reuse is based on structured Pibo Session fields: parent id, target profile, and metadata containing the subagent name/tool name/thread key.

Subagent tools are synchronous normal tools: they wait for the correlated child reply and return it to the calling agent. A depth guard prevents accidental recursive subagent loops. Long-running subagent work should be started through yielded runs by wrapping the subagent tool with `pibo_run_start`.

## Yielded Runs

Profiles with yieldable tools receive run-control tools. These are agent-facing tools, not gateway actions:

```text
pibo_run_start
pibo_run_list
pibo_run_status
pibo_run_wait
pibo_run_read
pibo_run_cancel
pibo_run_ack
```

`pibo_run_start` wraps one yieldable tool call as a yielded run and returns a `runId`. The wrapped tool still exists as a normal synchronous tool; the run wrapper only changes execution lifecycle. Built-in yieldable tools include generated `pibo_subagent_<name>` tools and `pibo_exec`.

Yielded runs use `tracked` by default. Tracked runs create compact `<pibo_run_notification>` service messages for the parent agent when they start, finish, fail, or remain unconsumed across natural turn boundaries. Notifications contain only run ids and summaries; the agent must call `pibo_run_read` to retrieve the full result. `detached` runs are explicit fire-and-forget work: they remain inspectable with `includeDetached`, but they do not create automatic reminders.

The router keeps one active parent turn at a time by enqueuing notifications as normal service messages. Service notifications do not immediately re-trigger themselves. Running runs are cancelled when their owning session or router is disposed, detached terminal runs are pruned after a short TTL, and consumed terminal tracked runs are kept briefly for debugging.

## Channels

Channels are plugin-owned adapters. They translate an external transport into pibo events and translate pibo output events back to that transport.

The channel context intentionally exposes only:

- `emit(event)` to route a `PiboInputEvent`.
- `subscribe(listener)` to observe `PiboOutputEvent` values.
- `getSession(id)`, `createSession(input)`, `updateSession(id, input)`, and `findSessions(input)` to work with first-class Pibo Session records.
- `getGatewayActions()` to discover execution actions for channel UIs.

Pibo Sessions are stored in SQLite by default at `.pibo/pibo-sessions.sqlite`. Channels and tools route by `PiboSession.id`; Pi and provider cache keys use `PiboSession.piSessionId`. Sidebar/tree nesting follows `parentId` only. Fork/clone derivation uses `originId` and does not imply nesting.

## Auth

Auth is a thin core service boundary exposed to channels through `PiboChannelContext`. The gateway validates that channels marked with `auth.mode: "required"` have an auth service before they start.

The first concrete implementation is Better Auth, registered through a built-in plugin for the web gateway path. It is intentionally not loaded by the default local gateway so trusted-local TCP flows do not require Google OAuth configuration. Web apps always require the web auth service, including localhost. The Auth plugin owns identity and allowlist checks; it does not own chat UI or agent routing.

Runtime config lives in `.pibo/config.json` and is managed through `pibo config ...`. Better Auth reads this local config; environment variables are not part of the auth configuration path.

```text
Same-Origin Web Host
  -> Better Auth /api/auth/*
  -> Chat Web App /apps/chat and /api/chat/*
  -> auth/session policy
  -> create or select Pibo Session(ownerScope=user:<userId>, channel=pibo.chat-web)
  -> Session router
```

The V1 chat web app uses Better Auth Google sign-in for every request path, including localhost. The authenticated Better Auth user id becomes `ownerScope=user:<userId>`. New personal sessions are top-level Pibo Sessions with `channel: "pibo.chat-web"` and `kind: "chat"`. Fork and clone results are visible branch sessions with `originId`. `parentId` is reserved for true child sessions such as subagents, not for ordinary sessions owned by the same user.

The auth boundary is enforced before channel input reaches the session router:

- no Better Auth session returns `401`
- a missing or empty `auth.allowedEmails` allowlist prevents Better Auth startup
- a Google account outside `auth.allowedEmails` returns `403`
- allowed users can list and select their own Pibo Sessions by `ownerScope`
- chat mutation routes require same-origin JSON requests

Google OAuth redirect URIs remain per deployment. Local QA can use `http://localhost:4788/api/auth/callback/google`; internet-facing deployments must configure their own `https://<host>/api/auth/callback/google` in Google Cloud Console and set `auth.baseURL` to the same origin. LAN development can use an sslip.io origin such as `http://4788.192.168.0.204.sslip.io` when that exact callback URI is registered with Google and configured as `auth.baseURL`. Pibo does not attempt wildcard redirect support because Google requires exact redirect URI matching for web-server OAuth.

## Web Host And Apps

The same-origin web path is intentionally split:

- `pibo.web-host` starts the HTTP channel and routes `/api/auth/*` plus registered web apps.
- `pibo.chat-web` registers the current chat UI/API as a web app.
- Future apps can register additional web apps without becoming part of the Auth plugin.

This avoids iframe and cross-origin complexity for V1. Apps can use normal same-origin cookies and call their own API routes while sharing the gateway auth boundary.

When the web host sits behind a local reverse proxy, it reconstructs the public request origin from `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` only for loopback proxy connections. This lets nginx map `http://4788.<lan-ip>.sslip.io` to `127.0.0.1:4788` without breaking chat mutation CSRF checks. Direct non-loopback clients cannot spoof those forwarded headers.

### Chat Web Live Stream

The Chat Web App exposes live updates through `GET /api/chat/events?piboSessionId=...` as server-sent events. This stream is intentionally a transport adapter over normalized `PiboOutputEvent` values, not a new source of truth.

The adapter lives in `src/apps/chat/stream.ts`. It turns full router events into compact, AG-UI-inspired frames:

- `RUN_STARTED`, `RUN_FINISHED`, and `RUN_ERROR` mark the lifecycle of a routed turn.
- `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, and `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` stream assistant text by delta.
- `REASONING_MESSAGE_START`, `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT`, and `REASONING_MESSAGE_END` stream reasoning text separately from visible assistant text.
- `TOOL_CALL_START`, `TOOL_CALL_ARGS`, and `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` stream tool state without resending the whole event history.
- `AGENT_DELEGATION` links subagent child sessions into the parent trace.
- `EXECUTION_RESULT` carries wrapper action results.
- `RAW_EVENT` is the compatibility fallback for output events without a compact frame yet.

The HTTP response still uses plain SSE with `event: pibo`; the optimization is the payload shape. Content deltas send only the new token or character chunk plus a stable message id. The React chat UI applies these frames directly to the current trace view and only refreshes `/api/chat/trace` for lifecycle or structural updates. The raw Pibo event log remains persisted in the Chat Web Read Model for reconstruction and debugging.

## Local Routed TUI

`src/local/` contains the explicit local routed TUI adapter. It starts a Pi TUI controller shell with builtin tools disabled, then routes normal input through an in-process `PiboSessionRouter`.

The local adapter is intentionally not a gateway replacement and not a second runtime:

- `src/local/client.ts` owns the in-process router client, a local Pibo Session, and router cleanup.
- `src/local/extension.ts` owns Pi TUI input interception, conservative slash-command filtering, autocomplete filtering, and mapping normalized routed events onto Pi TUI render components.
- `src/local/tui.ts` wires the controller profile, client, extension, and `runPiboTui` together.

V1 is opt-in through `npm run tui:routed -- <profile>`. The existing `npm run tui -- <profile>` path remains direct Pi TUI and does not auto-select routed mode. Details live in `docs/local-routed-tui.md`.

## Operator CLIs

The operator CLIs are optimized for agent-driven discovery. Each level should answer only the question for that level and point to the next command. Broad usage guides, schemas, and environment details are printed only by explicit deeper commands such as `schema`, `show`, `doctor`, or `guide`.

`pibo mcp` is a local operator tool for discovering and calling external MCP servers from the shell. It is separate from the pibo plugin/runtime boundary: MCP servers are configured in `mcp_servers.json`, not in `PiboPluginRegistry`, and their tools are invoked directly by the CLI. The usage guide lives in `docs/mcp.md`.

`pibo tools` is the matching operator surface for curated external CLI tools. These are not MCP servers and are not Pibo profile skills. A tool entry can install an isolated runtime, expose doctor/path/env commands, and print on-demand guides for agents. The first curated tool is `browser-use`, installed under `~/.pibo/tools/browser-use` with its own Python venv and tool home.

## MCP CLI

The CLI supports:

- stdio MCP servers through `command`, `args`, `env`, and `cwd`.
- HTTP MCP servers through `url` and optional `headers`.
- per-server `allowedTools` and `disabledTools` glob filters.
- listing tools, inspecting server/tool schemas, grep-style tool search, and JSON tool calls.
- short-lived daemon connections for faster repeated calls, disabled with `MCP_NO_DAEMON=1`.

The config helper commands live under `pibo mcp config ...` and can create, show, add, and remove server definitions. The runtime lookup order is explicit `-c/--config`, `MCP_CONFIG_PATH`, project-local `mcp_servers.json`, then the user-level MCP config paths.

`pibo mcp registry ...` is a thin convenience layer over the same config file. Registry entries are curated presets for optional MCP servers and are not active until installed. Python-based presets get isolated virtual environments under `~/.pibo/mcp-tools/<name>`, managed on demand through `uv`. Installing a preset writes a normal `mcpServers` entry, so the runtime path stays identical to manually added servers. The registry currently has no bundled presets.

The MCP daemon keeps expensive stdio server connections warm between CLI invocations. It is a local convenience cache only; server state and security still belong to the configured MCP server.

## CLI Tools

`pibo tools` keeps curated command-line tools discoverable without pushing their usage instructions into every agent context. Installed tool runtimes live under `~/.pibo/tools/<name>`. A tool can expose one or more guides, but those guides are only printed when requested through the CLI.

The first bundled tool preset is `browser-use`, pinned to `browser-use[cli]==0.12.6` so its CLI surface matches the bundled guide text. Its guides are available through:

```bash
npm run dev -- tools guides browser-use
npm run dev -- tools guide browser-use browser-use
npm run dev -- tools guide browser-use remote-browser
```

## Current Scripts

```bash
npm run gateway
npm run gateway:web
npm run client -- <piboSessionId>
npm run tui -- [profile]
npm run tui:routed -- [profile]
npm run profile -- [profile]
npm run dev -- mcp
npm run dev -- tools
```

`npm run tui:routed` runs the explicit local routed TUI adapter without requiring the gateway daemon.
